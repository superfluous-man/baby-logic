<div class="epigraph">
<p>If God did not exist it would be necessary to invent him.<br><br>
—Voltaire</p>
</div>
<p><strong><em>What is the relation</em></strong> between religion and ethics? Many people insist on their close connection. They also often claim that the only way to provide an alternative to the “anything goes” attitude of the relativists is to turn, or return, to a set of strict ethical rules grounded in religion. This chapter examines these claims. We will do this by looking at two of the most important approaches to providing a foundation for ethics in religion. The first emphasizes the authoritative character of religion, highlighting one traditional role played by God in monotheistic faiths, that of providing laws for human conduct. This approach is known as Divine Command Theory and is most popular, in the United States, among conservative Protestants. The second emphasizes the order inherent in the natural world, considered as something created by and reflecting the plans of a divine creator. It is known as Natural Law Theory and is the official ethical theory of the Roman Catholic Church. Before we get to these particular theories it is worth considering in more general terms what motivates them both. What are they trying to accomplish and why?</p>
<p><strong><em>It almost goes without saying</em></strong> that when any public figure in the United States speaks about things like “values,” or “morality” they are usually talking about religion. Hence it probably wouldn’t come as a surprise that the political organization called <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2007/05/17/rev-falwells-moral-majority-mission-accomplished/">The Moral Majority</a> was a Christian group that advocated a much greater role for religion in public life. But on what basis do we make this assumption that morality and religion are so closely connected? There are a number of reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of us learn about what matters, about values, early in life in the context of religion. We are often taught about right and wrong in more or less explicitly religious terms.</li>
<li>Religious leaders have the reputation of being experts on moral and ethical issues, they serve as ethics and morality advisers to political and military leaders and often express concerns about the morality of scientific research and new technologies.</li>
<li>In many religions God plays the role of the source of morality – he/she/it is often considered the highest good and the giver of the laws.</li>
<li>Societies lacking strong religious traditions have a tendency to embrace moral and ethical pluralism, or at least an openly tolerant attitude about many questions of individual conduct and social roles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Now this doesn’t yet</em></strong> show that morality and public order must be based on religion as Voltaire seemed to assume when he asserted that “If God didn’t exist we would have to invent him” as a method of social control. But at least it shows that many people are comfortable with asserting a close connection between the two. It is important to keep in mind, however, a distinction between three things: the origin, explanation and justification of a thing or concept.</p>
<div class="note infobox">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> we should keep in mind the distinction between three things.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <em>origins</em> of an idea, thought or principle.</li>
<li>An <em>explanation</em> of why someone might have it.</li>
<li>The <em>justification</em> of that idea, thought or principle.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Even if religion</em></strong> is often <em>a source</em> of moral ideas, does this mean that religion is <em>necessary</em> for morality? Even if we can <em>explain</em> the role of religion in societies in part by its role in providing moral guidance, does that mean that religion is the only possible source of moral ideas or that it <em>can</em> in fact provide an adequate justification of those ideas? Backers of the theories we will be looking at here claim that we <em>need</em> religion, or at least a religiously inspired conception of reality, if there is to be any hope of avoiding the trap of moral relativism. Likewise, they assume that their theoretical attempts to provide a detailed account of how religion might provide a framework on which to build morality are up to the task. We shall see soon how things work out.</p>
<div id="divine-command-theory" class="section level2" number="6.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Divine Command Theory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#divine-command-theory"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><strong><em>Divine Command Theory starts out</em></strong> as a reflection on the nature of moral language and on this basis develops a comprehensive theory of morality. The first thing it points out about moral or ethical language is that it takes the form of rules governing behavior. These rules are expressed as commands, such as “Don’t lie,” “Don’t steal from other people,” and “You should never cheat, especially not on your ethics exams.” Now commands, as opposed to statements, are neither true nor false, so we cannot simply investigate the world to see whether they are correct or not. Instead the way we determine which commands are “correct” is by figuring out which ones we really should listen to, which ones are truly binding on us and most importantly why? Why should we accept and act on the claims that some things are obligatory for us to do, while some other things are permissible and some other things forbidden?</p>
<div class="note infobox">
<p><strong>According to divine command theory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moral principles tell us what we <em>should</em> do.</li>
<li>Commands are meaningless without authority to back them up.</li>
<li>The universal scope of moral commands requires divine backing.</li>
<li>Moral rules such as “Do not kill,” really mean “God commands us not to kill.”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong><em>This theory claims that</em></strong> moral commands are binding on us only to the extent there is some kind of actually existing authority figure behind them, whose will determines that we should obey his her or its dictates. That is, in order for moral commands to really become obligations for us we need someone or something that can make them stick and give us a reason to accept them as such. On this view commands can only get their binding power from an enforcing authority, and the stronger that authority is, the more binding the commands are. This is not an unfamiliar idea. Why is it necessary for the police to patrol highways looking for people driving faster than the speed limit? Well, obviously, if nobody were around to enforce the rules of the road, many more people would violate them and it would be unsafe to drive on public roads. It is the real threat of punishment by people with the authority to enforce the rules that keeps us in line. The same goes for morality in general, or so the backers of Divine Command Theory claim.</p>
<div id="implications-of-dct" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Implications of DCT<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#implications-of-dct"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>In recent years</em></strong> there has been much debate surrounding attempts to display the Ten Commandments in public places, such as on the <a href="http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1525">wall of a courtroom in Alabama</a>, or outside the state legislature building in <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0301/Supreme-Court-lets-stand-order-to-remove-Ten-Commandments-monument">Oklahoma</a>. Defenders of this idea clearly are relying on ideas similar to those expressed by DCT. They reason that the authority of the law embodied in a court room or legislature is weakened if it is not ultimately based on divine authority. The only way, they claim, to emphasize the absolutely binding character of human law is to remind us that it is based on, or should be based on, a higher, divine law. So the first implication of DCT is that, if it is true, then moral laws would be absolutely binding on us. It would not be up to us what is right and what is wrong, but up to a higher authority. As a result this would provide an absolute basis for human law, and, in addition, enable us to escape from relativism for good.</p>
<p><strong><em>This may seem appealing</em></strong>, especially in the light of the relativist’s difficulty with moral decision-making. If the relativist has a hard time taking a stance on anything, no matter how obviously appalling it seems, DCT more than makes up for this by insisting on absolutes. If moral language is really a series of divinely issued commands, then there would be no question about whether or not something is wrong. To find out we just consult God’s explicit commands.</p>
<p><strong><em>This solution</em></strong> to the problem of morality, however, presents a number of problems. First, how can we be sure that we really know what it is that God commands? For devout followers of a particular religion, this problem usually never arises, since religious texts such as the Bible are often very explicit about what God commands. To find out what God commands us to do, we need simply consult the Bible. But then what about people of different faiths? Christians, for example, are commanded to honor the Sabbath or day of rest and not to work on Sundays. But Jews are commanded to do the same thing by not working on Saturdays, while Muslims can only honor the day of rest by not working on Fridays. All of these commands cannot simultaneously be absolutely binding on us, unless we opt for mandatory three day weekends (not necessarily a bad thing). And the same problem arises regarding other more serious matters and even within a particular religion. On the one hand, the God of Christianity seems to command us to kill certain people – according to the Old Testament book of Leviticus, this would include people who commit adultery, people who work on Sundays, and even our own children if they curse us. But then there is the First Commandment which says simply, “Thou shalt not kill.” In the Old Testament there is the famous demand for “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,” as pay-back for crimes committed. But then in the New Testament we find Jesus advising his followers, to “turn the other cheek,” and explicitly not seek pay-back for others’ crimes against them. Certainly we can’t be expected to take conflicting commands literally and put them all into practice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Now none of this </em></strong> completely undermines DCT, but it certainly presents a challenge to backers of the theory. If DCT is going to offer a reasonable approach to ethical decision making we will have to sort out quite a bit of the content of religious teachings. We will have to figure out which body of religious ideas really reflects God’s commands and what those commands are really telling us to do. And this of course requires interpretation – hopefully with some guidance from moral principles, but I am getting ahead of the argument here.</p>
<p><strong><em>In addition</em></strong>, DCT has an added implication that some people may find troubling. That is, since it claims that morality can only be based directly on the commands of God, then someone who does not believe that a God exists cannot have any real basis for moral decision making. Although it is true that an atheist may act in a way that appears to be moral, in fact, without an absolute authority figure to motivate this action, there is really no reason for her to do so. Advocates of DCT do not usually see this a much of a problem, since they insist that the atheists out there are obviously incapable of being moral unless they secretly harbor the suspicion that there may be an ultimate enforcer and hedge their bets accordingly. But is this really true? Is it possible to be a moral person in the complete absence of belief in a supreme being who is the ultimate authority figure enforcing moral rules? Is there any humanly accessible reason for being moral that does not reduce to culturally relative local customs?</p>
<p><strong><em>We will return</em></strong> to this question later. At this point, we need to examine the arguments in favor of DCT because, as we saw with relativism, the implications of a theory do not by themselves determine whether or not we should accept that theory. These implications only show us what is at stake with the theory and do not yet give us any reason to conclude that its claims are either true or false. To come to that kind of conclusion we need to see the back up for the theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="defending-dct" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Defending DCT<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defending-dct"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There are two major arguments for DCT, one of which is based on an explicitly religious assumption and the other of which is not. The religious, or theological, argument goes like so:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="argument">
<p>If God created everything, then this has to include moral rules, otherwise there would be something that God did not create.<br>
God created everything.<br></p>
<p>So God must have created whatever moral rules there are.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>A very clear</em></strong> and simple argument it seems, but is it very convincing? Well it is valid, since if the premises are true then the conclusion must also be true. OK. So are the premises really true? The first simply defines what a creator God would do, if such a God really existed – this is a pretty standard understanding of God shared by all of the great western monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. So far so good. The second premise, however, is not necessarily true. Granted that people who are true believers in one one of these religions take this as an article of faith, it certainly requires much more argument before anyone else is willing to accept it. So in the end this argument will be found appealing only to those who are members of certain religious faiths. As we will see in a moment, however, even true believers may have reason to reject DCT in spite of this argument.</p>
<p><strong><em>The second argument</em></strong> is a classic argument from the philosophy of religion, where it is sometimes used in the attempt to prove that a God exists in the first place. For our purposes, that is not as important as its role in the attempt to put ethics in a religious foundation.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="argument">
<p>If there is no absolute moral authority, then anything goes.<br>
But it is not true that anything goes.<br><br>
Thus there is an absolute moral authority,and that authority is God.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Once again</em></strong> this is a valid argument. So our evaluation of it needs for its completion a discussion of whether or not the premises are true. The obvious starting point for critical analysis of this argument is the second premise “It is just not true that anything goes.” How can we just assert that this is true, if this is exactly the kind of thing that is up for grabs in a discussion of philosophical ethics? After all, relativists deny this very claim. Well, at the very least, this premise makes a believable claim – some kinds of behavior are just flat out wrong. If you deny this, you will end up in the uncomfortable position of having to explain how it is that some pretty awful kinds of behavior might be acceptable. For example (and this is the classic example used by defenders of this argument), it is simply unacceptable to kill babies for fun. Try to respond that this is just a matter of culturally relative preference and you will look like a monster.</p>
<p><strong><em>Perhaps this discussion</em></strong> is best avoided by shifting our focus to the first premise. Is it true that “If there is no absolute moral authority, then anything goes?” At first it may seem that this is true. But if we stop and think for a second we soon realize that this claim sounds suspiciously like what DCT is ultimately claiming. Isn’t the point of the theory to defend the claim that the absolute authority of God is the only thing capable of preventing moral anarchy? If that is the case, then rewriting the conclusion as a premise and basing our argument on this premise is a clear example of the fallacy of <a href="chap-truth-table.html#begging-the-question">begging the question</a>. While an argument that begs the question may be valid, it is terrible as an argument because it assumes the very thing it is claiming to be proving. So this argument does not do so well in our analysis – it will only convince people who already buy DCT, and that is not enough to show that DCT is true.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> A Nasty Dilemma<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-nasty-dilemma"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<div class="epigraph">
<p>The point which I should first wish to understand is whether the pious or holy is beloved by the gods because it is holy, or holy because it is beloved of the gods.<br><br>
—Plato</p>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Let us return</em></strong> to the first argument in defense of DCT, the theological argument. This argument again seems valid, and appears to be an argument that anyone who believes that God is the creator of everything would have to accept. Everything means everything, including whatever moral rules there happen to be. There is a subtle problem that emerges here, however, a problem that has come to be known as the “dilemma of Divine Command Theory.” “Dilemma” is a Greek word that means “two horns” as in the two horns of a bull. So when we are caught in a dilemma, we are stuck between two positions that are equally uncomfortable and we might want to question what led us into the dilemma in the first place.</p>
<p><strong><em>The dilemma</em></strong> is easy to state. If ethics is to be based on God’s commands we can always ask the question “Well, why should we listen to these commands?” There are two possible answers: On the one hand we can listen to them simply because of who issued the commands. In this case what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong, because God says so. On the other hand, we can listen to the commands because they are commands telling us to do what is right. That is, God would be commanding us to do something because it is right. Think about that one for a minute.</p>
<p><strong><em>The point of DCT</em></strong> is to base right and wrong on what God says. But we can do this only in these two different ways: either we believe what God is saying because of who is saying it, or we believe it on the assumption that whoever is saying it has a good reason to say it. But are either of these options what divine command theory wants? Let’s look more closely at how this plays out for the command not to murder. Suppose God commands us not to murder each other.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is murder wrong because</em></strong> God says it is? This would seem to be a way of basing right and wrong directly on God’s will. But if this is all there is to murder being wrong, why couldn’t God have said the opposite? If it’s wrong only because He says so, there is no answer to this question. If this is what it means to say that ethics is based on God’s will, God appears totally arbitrary, and that’s not how we want to think of God, is it?</p>
<p><strong><em>Does God say that murder is wrong because</em></strong> it really is wrong? This definitely seems to fit better with how we usually think of God, as a supremely wise being. But this makes it look like standards of right and wrong are independent of God – he knows and does not simply decree that murder is wrong. This seems OK except for the fact that Divine Command Theory claims that right (and wrong) are based on God’s will.</p>
<div class="caution infobox">
<p><strong>The dilemma of DCT</strong></p>
<p>Is something wrong <strong>because God says so</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>This would make morality <em>arbitrary</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or does God say something is wrong because <strong>it really is wrong</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>This would make morality <em>independent</em> of God’s will.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>So we end up with a nasty dilemma – either we base ethics on God’s commands directly, but at the price of rendering ethical rules arbitrary, with no real reason behind them, or we grant that they have a reason behind them at the price of making the authority of God irrelevant to the rightness of these commands. Note that this dilemma is the same dilemma that arises any time we <a href="chap-truth-table.html#appeal-to-authority">appeal to authority</a> to settle some issue. When someone says for example “Experts says that blah, blah, blah,” we can always ask, “Should we listen to that because it is the experts who say it, or because the experts are right?” To avoid granting the experts arbitrary power to tell us what to do, it has to be the second. But that then renders the experts irrelevant in a sense. After all, if what the experts say is right, this has nothing to do with who they are and everything to do with what they say. So let them present their evidence and let us be the judges of whether to listen or not. Because of this problem, Divine Command Theory is rejected even by some people who insist that morality must be based on religion. The Catholic Church, for example, officially rejects this explanation of why ethics needs religion. It prefers instead, the next theory, Natural Law Theory.</p>

<p><strong><em>Natural Law Theory (NLT)</em></strong>, as the name suggests, argues that there are standards for right and wrong and these are to be found in nature. Natural things are built (whether by a divine creator or by Darwinian evolution doesn’t matter here) to be good at certain types of things. Fish are good swimmers, but bad typists. Dogs are good at smelling things in your luggage, but bad at flying. Trees are good at turning solar energy, water and carbon dioxide into sugars, and bad at solving calculus problems. Another way of saying the same thing is to appeal to the concept of a natural function: fish, dogs, trees, and all other natural things, including us humans, have a certain set of built in potentials, or functions, things they are built to do and can do well. Things that are not part of their natural abilities they shouldn’t be doing at all. Natural law theory in ethics is based on this idea. Human beings have a certain set of things we can all do and that we can also do well or poorly. By nature us humans can:</p>
<ul>
<li>move physically through our surroundings;</li>
<li>perceive things around us and learn about how the world works through observation and experiment;</li>
<li>maintain our bodies and minds in a healthy state;</li>
<li>be emotionally engaged in our lives and the lives of others;</li>
<li>be creative and enjoy the products of others’ creativity;</li>
<li>be productive and politically active members of society;</li>
<li>have and raise children.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>All of these capacities</em></strong> combined make up what humans can do by nature. In spite of the fact that this list seems long, there are of course plenty of things that we cannot do by nature, like fly under our own power, or survive underwater without an artificial air supply. Given all of this, the fundamental claim of Natural Law Theory is just that ethics can and should be based on these natural functions. Ethical decisions are decisions that follow from and foster human nature, while unethical decisions are those that go against our natures. So far this may not seem to be a particularly religious approach to ethics as it was billed above. In a sense, the religious reading of natural law theory is optional – the claims it makes could be cast in an entirely secular light, by simply referring to nature. However, not only is the most popular version of this theory the one embraced by the Catholic Church, but the tradition from which this theory arose saw nature as the result of supernatural forces at work – God’s creation. So even the religious aspect of Natural Law Theory may not be required for the theory itself, to the extent that talk about natural purposes evokes the purposes of the creator of natural things, the two are closely connected.</p>

<p><strong>According to NLT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding things requires understanding their purpose.</li>
<li>Human nature is clearly visible by the “light of reason.”</li>
<li>It is better to follow the natural order of things than to oppose it.</li>

<h3>Implications of NLT<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#implications-of-nlt"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>This theory may sound simple</em></strong> and even a little trivial, but, as we shall soon see, it has far-reaching implications. In addition, it fits in very well with certain intuitions we may have about what is involved in living a good life. We all have some conception of what a good life would look like, and our individual conceptions of a good life no doubt overlap. Among others, elements of a good life would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>having a healthy body and mind;</li>
<li>knowing enough about our world to be able to effectively realize our personal goals;</li>
<li>having friends and a family who love and understand us, and who are willing to help us out in times of need;</li>
<li>living in a comfortable community with people who share our values;</li>
<li>having an interesting and rewarding job that fits our abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>According to NLT</em></strong> it is no accident that these are elements of a good life in most peoples’ view, because all of these things involve realizing or fulfilling some of our naturally given capacities mentioned above. In fact, for NLT, living a good life is not only what many people aspire to, it is the naturally given goal of human beings. Fulfilling our natural capacities, realizing the set of capacities we are all born with is also what we should strive for. We should, to borrow a famous slogan, “Be all we can be.” In the eyes of a backer of NLT this slogan is not intended only as a way of encouraging us to do our best, it is also an expression of an ethical demand – we should strive to realize our natural potential to the greatest extent possible and we are acting wrongly if we do not listen to this demand.</p>
<p><strong><em>But what about people</em></strong> who fail to realize their naturally given potential? In some cases people are prevented from realizing their potential because of factors outside of their control, such as disease or accidents. Someone afflicted with a childhood disease may be prevented from ever realizing the potentials they were born with and this is an unfortunate accident. But someone who has no excuse besides, say laziness, who fails to live up to his or her potential deserves to be condemned. Such a person is a “slacker,” a “dead-beat,” living a wasted life – even the language we use to describe someone who fails to live up to their potential has a tone of moral disapproval. For a backer of natural law theory, a person who does not follow human nature and strive to be all that they can be is wrong to do so.</p>
<p><strong><em>On the other hand</em></strong>, if a whole society is filled with people who fail to realize their potentials, this is good grounds for suspecting that there is something wrong with the way in which that society is run. In fact, both nations and international organizations such as the United Nations increasingly measure the prosperity of countries not just by GDP growth rates, but by determining to what extent people are well-fed, employed, educated, in good health, etc. It is a common assumption (is it warranted?) in international affairs that if a country is systematically preventing its citizens from realizing their potential, if it is frustrating the fulfillment of their basic human needs, then there is something wrong with that society and it should be encouraged or prodded to change.</p>
<p><strong><em>Taking this idea still further</em></strong>, in the hands of Aquinas, Natural Law Theory leads to the idea that there are certain absolute values, things that we must value without exception. If human flourishing is an ethical demand that nature makes on us by providing us with a set of built-in capacities, there are certain things that we must always value as preconditions for realizing those capacities. These are, in Aquinas’ view,</p>
<ul>
<li>life</li>
<li>procreation</li>
<li>knowledge</li>
<li>sociability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>If we fail to honor</em></strong> these values, we cannot realize our potentials as nature (or its creator) intends. This is most obvious for the first of these absolute values, but the case could be made that if we fail to have children, seek knowledge and develop our social abilities, us human beings would fail miserably in our attempts to realize our natural capacities. It is for this reason that these values simply must be honored – everything else depends on them. Such are the implications of the theory – now on to the important question, “But is it true that right and wrong can be determined by how well or poorly we live up to our natural potentials?”</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Ethics and Human Nature<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ethics-and-human-nature"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><strong><em>The argument for NLT</em></strong> is straightforward. It rests on one factual premise and one premise that contains a value judgment, and runs like so:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="argument">
<p>Human beings have a definite nature, a set of built-in capacities.<br>
In general it is better to follow nature than to go against it.<br><br>
So we should act in such a way as to fulfill our nature as human beings and avoid violating what it is in our nature to do.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>This argument has a long history</em></strong>, and goes back at least as far as the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BCE), a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great. It was revived and recast in explicitly religious terms by the great medieval Christian philosopher, and official philosopher of the Catholic Church, St. Thomas Aquinas (1227-1274). It is the foundation of Natural Law Theory and one way of defending a broader view known as Virtue Ethics, both of which equate an ethical life with a life spent realizing our potentials as well-rounded human beings.</p>
<p><strong><em>As a quick look</em></strong> at the argument indicates, it is at least a valid argument. If we have a definite nature and if in fact it is better to follow that nature, then we should clearly follow our particular, human nature. We should all act in the way that is most likely to lead to the fulfillment of our natural functions. But is there anything wrong with this picture? It may seem appealing to talk about what human beings are naturally built to do, and it’s true that many people talk about how “we just weren’t meant to do that.” But the question is, how can we be so sure what a human being’s natural functions or abilities really are? And besides, doesn’t this argument seem to rest on a hidden assumption that what is natural is always better, or that what is unnatural is wrong? Can nature really be a guide for the making of value judgments?</p>
<p><strong><em>Natural law theory assumes</em></strong> that the following claim is true: “Whatever is unnatural is wrong.” But is it? It is not so easy to say since the word “unnatural” has a number of different meanings. It can mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going against the laws of nature, as in “Hot snow is unnatural.”</li>
<li>Being statistically uncommon, as in “He has an unnatural ability to remember what cards were played at the blackjack table.”</li>
<li>Being artificial, as in “Those snack foods are made only of unnatural ingredients.”</li>
<li>Violating natural functions, as in “It is unnatural for a lesbian couple to have a child with the help of a sperm bank and a team of doctors.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Let’s look at these</em></strong> definitions one at a time:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>Violating the laws of nature is wrong.</em> This is clearly false in that the laws of nature are just descriptions of regularities in nature and so it makes no sense to talk about violating them. Apparent violations of the law really just show us that our view of what the laws of nature <em>are</em> is incorrect.</li>
<li>
<em>What is uncommon is wrong.</em> Clearly this is not always the case – being part of the statistically defined norm is neither good not bad by itself. Rare talents are great, rare diseases not so good.</li>
<li>
<em>What is artificial is wrong.</em> While we might resist buying food labelled “All artificial ingredients,” and assume that natural ingredients are better than artificial ones, this claim is not in general true. There are plenty of things like artificial heart valves and limbs that have made people’s lives better and many perfectly natural phenomena like tornadoes and earthquakes that have not.</li>
<li>
<strong>What violates natural functions is wrong.</strong> This claim is really what Natural Law Theory rests on, but it also seems a bit shaky as a support for morality as we will see in a moment.</li>
</ol>
<div id="natural-purposes" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Natural purposes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#natural-purposes"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>The whole idea that</em></strong> things in nature have built-in purposes that it is somehow wrong to violate is somewhat paradoxical in that it is both intuitively appealing and difficult if not impossible to establish. It is intuitively appealing to think that things in nature have “essences” or some set of essential features that determine how they act and their roles in relationship to us. As the old saying goes, “Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly…” This spontaneous “essentialism” is part of what psychologists have termed “magical thinking” and it seems to be built-in to the way the human mind works.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;See &lt;span class="citation"&gt;[@gelmanEssentialismEverydayThought]&lt;/span&gt; for more on essentialism as a spontaneous mode of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>8</sup></a> Hence both children and early human societies tend to accept without reservation the idea that everything has a place in the world and certain internal characteristics that it would be wrong to ignore. And this makes sense to the extent that categorizing is a basic mental function that comes online first and only later are its products subject to critical reevaluation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Until the scientific revolution</em></strong> finally rejected the idea that explanations of natural phenomena required specifying what the purpose, end or function of something was, this kind of essentialism was simply taken for granted as part of the explanation of <em>anything</em>. Aristotle was the first to explicitly formulate it as part of his account of the requirements of any explanation. According to Aristotle’s doctrine of “the four causes,” any explanation had to answer four questions about what was being explained:</p>
<div class="note infobox">
<p>For Aristotle any explanation requires specifying it’s “four causes.”</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is it made of. (the “material cause”)</li>
<li>What sort of thing it is. (its “formal cause”)</li>
<li>How it came to be in its present state. (the “efficient cause”)</li>
<li>What it is <strong>for</strong> or its function, purpose or goal. (its “final cause”)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong><em>This doctrine</em></strong> was incredibly influential and was only rejected as Galileo and other early modern scientists in the early 1500’s rejected all but the third of these as irrelevant to scientific explanation. Nevertheless, it is a central assumption of Aquinas’ account of morality that we both can and should spell out the purposes of anything in nature. If purposes are “built-in” the human beings then what we <em>should</em> do would be accessible in a straightforward way “by the light of reason.” However that no longer seems so obvious to modern eyes since we tend to see the purposes of things as externally imposed on them by creatures like us who use them for our purposes. Nature is no longer in our conception a place of built in forms and functions organized hierarchically in the Medieval “Great Chain of Being” or other such comprehensive views, but is more like a vast and value-neutral machine that we may be part of but that has no intrinsic values in its parts. Hence any account of value is, from this modern point of view, dependent on the free choices of those, like us, who value things. We will be seeing different conceptions of what this means in coming chapters.</p>
<p><strong><em>In conclusion</em></strong>, even though it may seem tempting to appeal to nature as a guide for ethics, this strategy simply does not work. Something being natural, to use philosophical jargon, is neither necessary not sufficient for it being good or right. Likewise with something being unnatural. Even if we could spell out the “natural functions” of human beings and our parts in a way that did not beg the question, doing so would still leave open the question, as the philosopher G. E. Moore pointed out, about whether following that function was right.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="citation"&gt;[@prestonMooreGeorgeEdward]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>9</sup></a> Nature provides a framework within which we can make choices that are either right or wrong or that lead either to good or evil and it is our responsibility, not nature’s to figure out which is which. Failure to recognize this is nothing but a trap – the trap of what Moore called the “<a href="chap-truth-table.html#the-naturalistic-fallacy">naturalistic fallacy</a>,” a mistaken form of reasoning with which we have already met.</p>

<h3>Religion and ethics reconsidered<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#religion-and-ethics-reconsidered"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>The ultimate conclusion</em></strong> of this chapter can be stated simply enough: In spite of the fact that religion often <em>expresses</em> moral concerns, morality and ethics are <em>logically independent</em> of religion. As a result we can see why it is that both Divine Command Theory and Natural Law Theory had to fail since both asserted the opposite, that without some connection to the divine, either directly or through a divinely ordered nature, ethics would be impossible. Note that this doesn’t mean that in human cultural history religious conceptions of ethics have not come first. Nor is it intended to deny that religion can be a powerful way of teaching ethical principles as it is for many people. It is just intended to mean that religion is neither necessary nor sufficient for ethics. It is not necessary in that one can be ethical without any religious belief. And it is not sufficient in that it is possible to have strong religious belief and be an awful person from a moral or ethical point of view.</p>
