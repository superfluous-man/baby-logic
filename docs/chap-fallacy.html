<div class="epigraph">
<p>If God did not exist it would be necessary to invent him.<br><br>
—Voltaire</p>
</div>
<p><strong><em>What is the relation</em></strong> between religion and ethics? Many people insist on their close connection. They also often claim that the only way to provide an alternative to the “anything goes” attitude of the relativists is to turn, or return, to a set of strict ethical rules grounded in religion. This chapter examines these claims. We will do this by looking at two of the most important approaches to providing a foundation for ethics in religion. The first emphasizes the authoritative character of religion, highlighting one traditional role played by God in monotheistic faiths, that of providing laws for human conduct. This approach is known as Divine Command Theory and is most popular, in the United States, among conservative Protestants. The second emphasizes the order inherent in the natural world, considered as something created by and reflecting the plans of a divine creator. It is known as Natural Law Theory and is the official ethical theory of the Roman Catholic Church. Before we get to these particular theories it is worth considering in more general terms what motivates them both. What are they trying to accomplish and why?</p>
<p><strong><em>It almost goes without saying</em></strong> that when any public figure in the United States speaks about things like “values,” or “morality” they are usually talking about religion. Hence it probably wouldn’t come as a surprise that the political organization called <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2007/05/17/rev-falwells-moral-majority-mission-accomplished/">The Moral Majority</a> was a Christian group that advocated a much greater role for religion in public life. But on what basis do we make this assumption that morality and religion are so closely connected? There are a number of reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of us learn about what matters, about values, early in life in the context of religion. We are often taught about right and wrong in more or less explicitly religious terms.</li>
<li>Religious leaders have the reputation of being experts on moral and ethical issues, they serve as ethics and morality advisers to political and military leaders and often express concerns about the morality of scientific research and new technologies.</li>
<li>In many religions God plays the role of the source of morality – he/she/it is often considered the highest good and the giver of the laws.</li>
<li>Societies lacking strong religious traditions have a tendency to embrace moral and ethical pluralism, or at least an openly tolerant attitude about many questions of individual conduct and social roles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Now this doesn’t yet</em></strong> show that morality and public order must be based on religion as Voltaire seemed to assume when he asserted that “If God didn’t exist we would have to invent him” as a method of social control. But at least it shows that many people are comfortable with asserting a close connection between the two. It is important to keep in mind, however, a distinction between three things: the origin, explanation and justification of a thing or concept.</p>
<div class="note infobox">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> we should keep in mind the distinction between three things.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <em>origins</em> of an idea, thought or principle.</li>
<li>An <em>explanation</em> of why someone might have it.</li>
<li>The <em>justification</em> of that idea, thought or principle.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Even if religion</em></strong> is often <em>a source</em> of moral ideas, does this mean that religion is <em>necessary</em> for morality? Even if we can <em>explain</em> the role of religion in societies in part by its role in providing moral guidance, does that mean that religion is the only possible source of moral ideas or that it <em>can</em> in fact provide an adequate justification of those ideas? Backers of the theories we will be looking at here claim that we <em>need</em> religion, or at least a religiously inspired conception of reality, if there is to be any hope of avoiding the trap of moral relativism. Likewise, they assume that their theoretical attempts to provide a detailed account of how religion might provide a framework on which to build morality are up to the task. We shall see soon how things work out.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">24.1</span> Divine Command Theory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#divine-command-theory-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><strong><em>Divine Command Theory starts out</em></strong> as a reflection on the nature of moral language and on this basis develops a comprehensive theory of morality. The first thing it points out about moral or ethical language is that it takes the form of rules governing behavior. These rules are expressed as commands, such as “Don’t lie,” “Don’t steal from other people,” and “You should never cheat, especially not on your ethics exams.” Now commands, as opposed to statements, are neither true nor false, so we cannot simply investigate the world to see whether they are correct or not. Instead the way we determine which commands are “correct” is by figuring out which ones we really should listen to, which ones are truly binding on us and most importantly why? Why should we accept and act on the claims that some things are obligatory for us to do, while some other things are permissible and some other things forbidden?</p>
<div class="note infobox">
<p><strong>According to divine command theory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moral principles tell us what we <em>should</em> do.</li>
<li>Commands are meaningless without authority to back them up.</li>
<li>The universal scope of moral commands requires divine backing.</li>
<li>Moral rules such as “Do not kill,” really mean “God commands us not to kill.”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong><em>This theory claims that</em></strong> moral commands are binding on us only to the extent there is some kind of actually existing authority figure behind them, whose will determines that we should obey his her or its dictates. That is, in order for moral commands to really become obligations for us we need someone or something that can make them stick and give us a reason to accept them as such. On this view commands can only get their binding power from an enforcing authority, and the stronger that authority is, the more binding the commands are. This is not an unfamiliar idea. Why is it necessary for the police to patrol highways looking for people driving faster than the speed limit? Well, obviously, if nobody were around to enforce the rules of the road, many more people would violate them and it would be unsafe to drive on public roads. It is the real threat of punishment by people with the authority to enforce the rules that keeps us in line. The same goes for morality in general, or so the backers of Divine Command Theory claim.</p>
