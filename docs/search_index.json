"],["全書緒論.html", " 1 全書緒論 1.1 论说 1.2 演绎 1.3 一致性 1.4 逻辑或「逻辑」的若干问题", " 1 全書緒論 Jacques-Louis David, “The Death of Socrates” “I know what you’re thinking about,” said Tweedledum; “but it isn’t so, nohow.” “Contrariwise,” continued Tweedledee, “if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn’t, it ain’t. That’s logic.”Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, 1872 在我上大学的时候，不少关于 X 的课程始于下面这样的问题： 什么是 X？（X 的定义） 学好 X 在理论上有什么意义？ 学好 X 在实践上有什么意义？ 怎样学好 X？…… 然后给出一些答案和细节，构成该课程的「绪言」。近年来，一些新出版的教科书仍沿袭这样的惯例，甚至「读经风」也要从「为什么要读」「读什么」和「怎样读」等问题刮起。这门课叫「符号逻辑」，是当代逻辑即数理逻辑的入门课程。按惯例，好像也该先讲讲什么是逻辑，什么是符号逻辑，什么是当代逻辑，为什么要学及如何学好逻辑，等等。 像「逻辑是什么」或「当代逻辑是什么」这类问题，如果问的是逻辑或当代逻辑等的定义，那么我劝初学者不必太认真。初学逻辑，自然想知道逻辑学大概是怎么回事，想知道逻辑学家大概做些什么。但是，若想满足这种好奇心，与其在脑子里装些不明不白的「定义」，倒不如对逻辑学里讨论的问题以及讨论的方法多一点认真。这是因为：对一个学科的整体上的理解，是以对该学科中的问题和方法的理解为前提的。当然，这并不是说，关于逻辑或数理逻辑的各种说法都不值得思考。这里的要点是：不具备足够逻辑知识的人，分不出这些说法的好坏高低，反而容易因为学了某些「定义」「分类」或「方向」，就自以为有些「逻辑学问」甚至「超逻辑学问」了。待到真有点逻辑学问后，再来思考这类问题为时不晚——只要那时还有这种兴趣。 在这门课上，把逻辑作为学科来谈时，通常都是指当代的形式逻辑，也称当代逻辑、现代逻辑或（广义）数理逻辑。我们虽不定义逻辑是什么，但以普通人的知识为背景，我们可以随便谈谈逻辑学大概讨论些什么问题。关于逻辑学有以下几种说法： 逻辑学是关于论说（argument）的。 逻辑学是关于推理（inference, reasoning）的。 逻辑学是关于理论或信念的一致性（consistency）的。 1.1 论说 无论是关于整个世界的某种看法，还是关于一类事物的某种理论，都是由一些句子来表达的。这些句子大体上可以分为两类：真句子和假句子。 在很多情况下，确定一个句子的真假的最基本方法是直接考察句中所谈的事物。但是，直接考察经常是做不到或不易做到的。因而，为确定一给定句子 \\(\\varphi\\) 的真假，人们往往需要比较 \\(\\varphi\\) 和某些已知其真假的句子 \\(\\psi_0\\),…,\\(\\psi_n\\)。即使只考虑是否应该相信 \\(\\varphi\\)，我们也常需比较 \\(\\varphi\\) 和某些我们相信或不相信的句子 \\(\\chi_0\\),…,\\(\\chi_n\\)。从 \\(\\psi_0\\),…,\\(\\psi_n\\)（或 \\(\\chi_0\\),…,\\(\\chi_n\\)）到 \\(\\varphi\\) 或其否定的过渡，通常被称为「推理」。［Henkin,1967］ 在上述语境中，\\(\\psi_0, \\cdots, \\psi_n\\)（或 \\(\\chi_0, \\cdots,\\chi_n\\)）常被称为「前提」，\\(\\varphi\\)（或其否定）常被称为「结论」。人们把一集前提和从它得出的结论合起来，称之为论说，亦称论证（argument）。这里，「推理」指从前提得出结论的过程，而「论说」指前提和结论的集合。 例 1.1 考虑下面的两句话，从中我们能得出什么结论？ 1. 人人都爱我的宝宝。 2. 我的宝宝只爱我。 人们可以去编些故事，比如说，「我」指某人，「宝宝」指她（他）的孩子或情人，等等。但假定张三说，他从例 1.1 得出「我的宝宝就是我」，我们会同意吗？张三是这样得出他的结论的（用「宝宝」代替「我的宝宝」）： 既然人人爱宝宝，而宝宝是人，所以宝宝爱宝宝。「宝宝只爱我」说的是：对任何 \\(x\\)，如果宝宝爱 \\(x\\)，那么 \\(x\\) 就是我；从而如果宝宝爱宝宝，那么宝宝就是我。既然宝宝爱宝宝，所以宝宝就是我。 通常人们用下述方法表示一个论说：将其前提和结论列出，用一道线将前提与结论分开，并在结论前加上「\\(\\therefore\\)」表示「所以」。比如，张三从例 1.1 中的前提到结论「我的宝宝就是我」的论说就可以表示为 人人都爱我的宝宝。 我的宝宝只爱我。 所以，我的宝宝就是我。 1.1.1 论说的好坏 论说有好有坏。逻辑学要做的事情之一，就是区分好的论说与坏的论说，或者说是给出一般的方法，而依据这些方法，我们能对论说的好坏作出正确的判断。这大概是对逻辑的最常见的一种说明。要说明上述示例是否好的论说，先要说明什么样的论说是好的，什么样的是不好的。对此，最直观又最简单的说法与下面说的差不多： 对任何一个论说，如果在每个使其前提都真的情况下，其结论也一定真，那么这个论说是好的；如果在某些情况下，该论说的前提都真而结论假，那么这个论说就是坏的（不好的）。 这种直观的说法可以让人对论说的好坏有个初步的印象，但不够清楚准确。比如，什么叫作「使前提都真的情况」，什么叫作「在某个情况下，一个命题是真的」，等等，现在都还不清楚。这种说法的优点，是它强调了论说的好坏不在于前提和结论的真假，而在于它们的真假在不同情况下的比较。 1.1.2 论说形式的好坏 一个具体论说的好坏与其前提和结论的真假无关：一个好论说的前提和结论可能都是假的，而一个坏论说的前提和结论也可能都是真的。（注：论说本身的好坏与论说形式的好坏是相互区别而又有联系的两个问题。） 例 1.2 比如下面这个论说： 1. 企鹅都是鸟。 2. 猴子都不是企鹅。 3. 所以，猴子都不是鸟。 定理 1.1 (Pythagorean theorem) For a right triangle, if \\(c\\) denotes the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\] 它的前提和结论都是真的，但人们仅凭直观就知道这个论说是不好的；人们会说：不是企鹅的不一定就不是鸟，比如说麻雀就不是企鹅，但不能因此说麻雀不是鸟。企鹅的确都是鸟，猴子的确都不是企鹅，并且猴子也的确都不是鸟；但是，最后一个命题之前的「所以」是没道理的。再看下面的论说： 示例 0.3 1. 爱运动的学生学习成绩都很好。 1. 男学生都爱运动。 1. 所以，男学生学习成绩都很好。 它的前提和结论都是假的，但整个论说似乎无懈可击。 常听到争论中的人说：「即使你的论证没问题，你的前提本身就是假的，结论当然也是假的。」这是一种常见的误解，仿佛好论说会「保存」虚假性，即会把前提的虚假性传到结论上。下例表明好论说并不保存虚假性： 示例 0.4 1. 所有的猫都是人。 1. 所有的学生都是猫。 1. 所以，所有的学生都是人。 易见两个前提都是假的，结论是真的，而整个论说也无懈可击。 前提有真有假的好论说或坏论说的例子也很多，不一一列举了。一般说来，真、假前提和真、假结论的各种组合情况，就坏论说而言都是可能的；就好论说而言也差不多，只有一个例外：好论说不会有真前提和假结论。 上面说过，对任何一个论说，如果在每个使其前提都真的情况下，其结论也一定真，那么这个论说是好的。所谓使前提都真的情况，简单地说就是能使所有前提同时成立的一种解释，而这种解释既可以是现实也可以和现实无关。比如我们讨论示例 0.2 中的坏论说时，给出的理由是「麻雀不是企鹅，但不能因此而说麻雀不是鸟」。这相当于把「猴子」换成了「麻雀」或是把「猴子」解释成了麻雀。当然，这是不够清楚的说法。清楚一些的说法涉及「论说的形式」（argument form）。 我们暂时依赖直观判断什么是一个论说的形式。比如下面是个具体的论说，以及它的形式： 示例 0.5 1. 所有的猫都是人。 1. 张三是猫。 1. 所以，张三是人。 所有 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)。 \\(a\\) 是 \\(S\\)。 所以，\\(a\\) 是 \\(P\\)。 再如下列是示例 0.2 、示例 0.3 的论证形式： 示例 0.6 1. 所有 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)。 1. 所有 \\(Q\\) 都不是 \\(S\\)。 1. 所以，所有 \\(Q\\) 都不是 \\(P\\)。 所有 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)。 所有 \\(Q\\) 是 \\(S\\)。 所以，所有 \\(Q\\) 是 \\(P\\)。 不同的论说可以有相同的形式，而具有相同形式的论说称为这个论说形式的特例（instance）。例如，示例 0.7 中有两个不同的论说，但它们的形式同是示例 0.6 上列之形式，并且同是该形式之特例。 示例 0.7 1. 企鹅都是鸟。 1. 猴子都不是企鹅。 1. 所以，猴子都不是鸟。 企鹅都是鸟。 麻雀都不是企鹅。 所以，麻雀都不是鸟。 一个论说形式的众多特例中有一类被称为「反例」。一个论说形式的反例（counter exampIe）是这个论说形式的特例，其所有前提都是真的，而其结论是假的。如果一个论说形式没有反例，那么该论说形式是好的；如果一个论说形式有反例，那么该论说形式是坏的（不好的）。 1.1.3 论说好坏取决于形式的好坏 一个论说的形式是好的（亦即它的形式没有反例），则称其为好的论说。一个论说的形式是坏的（亦即它的形式有反例），则称其为坏的论说。 既然具体论说的好坏在于它的形式的好坏，那么就任何具体论说而言，它的（前提和）结论真不足以说明它好，而它的（前提和）结论假也不足以说明它坏——它的好坏在于同样形式的特例中有没有前提真而结论假的论说。由此可知，要说明一个论说是坏的论说，最直接的方法是去找一个与它形式相同且前提真而结论假的论说。 我们来看如何说明一个论说是坏的论说。先考虑示例 0.7 右侧的论说，易见它的前提都真而结论假；我们知道其形式是示例 0.6 左列之形式，所以它是示例 0.6 左列形式的反例。既然示例 0.6 左列形式有反例，它就是坏的论说形式。现在来看示例 0.2 中的论说，亦即示例 0.7 左侧的论说，其形式也是示例 0.6 左列之形式。我们现在知道示例 0.6 左列形式是坏的论说形式，所以，示例 0.2 中的论说是个坏的论说。我们来看另一个论说： 示例 0.8 1. 浩毕特都生活在沙伊鄂。 1. 拜根斯都是浩毕特。 1. 所以，拜根斯都生活在沙伊鄂。 所有 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)。 所有 \\(Q\\) 是 \\(S\\)。 所以，所有 \\(Q\\) 是 \\(P\\)。 在了解「浩毕特」「沙伊鄂」和「拜根斯」的意思之前，我们无法判断示例 0.8 左列论证的前提或结论的真假。但是，我们知道其的形式是示例 0.8 右列之形式。 这个形式有下述特点：无论把什么类名词放在 S，P 或 Q 的位置上，都不会得到具有真前提和假结论的论说，即不会得到示例 0.8 右列形式的反例。这就是说，示例 0.8 右列之形式是好的论说形式。因为示例 0.8 左列之形式是示例 0.8 右列之形式的特例，所以它是个好的论说。 然，说一个论说形式没有反例，并非仅仅是说没有找到它的反例，因为没找到反例不等于没有反例。示例 0.8 右列之论说形式比较简单，容易看出它不会有反例；但是，一个好的论说形式可以很复杂，仅靠直观未必能说出它是否有反例。这门课程的任务之一，就是学会判别好坏论说形式的若干方法。 如果承认一个论说是好的，那么接受其前提就无法理性地拒绝其结论，从而否定其结论也就无法理性地坚持其前提；如果断定一个论说是坏的，那么接受其前提的同时可以拒绝其结论。用逻辑术语来说，如果一个论说是好的，那就意味着它的前提「逻辑蕴涵」（logically implies）它的结论（当代逻辑不仅讨论给定命题集合是否逻辑蕴涵某给定命题，它更要突破具体命题和具体命题集合的限制，把逻辑蕴涵关系作为对象来讨论。），或者说结论是前提的「逻辑后承」（logical consequence）；如果一个论说是坏的，那就意味着它的前提和结论之间没有逻辑蕴涵关系，亦即结论不是前提的逻辑后承。我们将在第一编中讨论逻辑蕴涵的一种简单形式——重言蕴涵（重言后承），而在第三编中讨论逻辑蕴涵（逻辑后承）。 1.2 演绎 前面列举的关于逻辑学的几种说法中，有一种是「逻辑学是关于推理的」。当谈到论说的好坏与推理的关系时，也有类似于下述命题的说法：对任何一个论说，如果从其前提能够合理地推出其结论，该论说就是好的；如果从其前提不能合理地推出其结论，该论说就是坏的（不好的）。 所谓「合理地推出结论」，通常被理解为一个末端是这个结论的推理链（chain of reasoning），它可以只有一两步，也可以有很多步，但（关键的是）每一步都要「合理」。对「合理性」的各种要求或解释，形成了不同类型的推理链。演绎（deduction）是这些类型中的一种。 演绎对「合理性」的基本要求是：「推理链」中的每个推理步骤，如果不是前提、定义、预设、公理、假设等或已经从这些东西「合理地」推出的命题，那么一定是从它们用某些明确的规则得到的。这些明确的规则都要有如下性质：在演绎中使用这些规则时，人们从真命题只能得到真命题。众所周知的各种三段论、假言推理规则和选言推理规则等就属于这种规则。（演绎中也常用被称之为「引理」和「定理」之类的东西。它们虽与公认的规则不同，但因为它们也是经演绎得到的，所以可以把它们看作是已经「合理地推出」的命题。）如此说来，至少直观上看，演绎像是将一个个好的论说接起来——它一步步推出的每个命题都是该命题前面某些命题的逻辑后承。 1.2.1 演绎的例子一 数学证明都是演绎的例子，我们就不列举了。这里来看另一类例子。上一节谈到示例 0.1 之论说，我们曾假定张三给岀了他的说明。那个说明其实就是个演绎的例子。虽然那个说明中的命题并没有列成链，而对每一步到下一步的过渡，也没说明是运用了什么规则；但是，人们可以把那个说明「还原」成符合上述说法的演绎： 示例 0.9 1. 所有的人都爱我的宝宝。➠ 前提（经过复述） 1. 我的宝宝是人。➠ 预设 1. 我的宝宝爱我的宝宝。➠ 三段论 1. 我的宝宝只爱我。➠ 前提 1. 对每个 \\(x\\)，如果我的宝宝爱 \\(x\\)，那么 \\(x\\) 就是我。➠ 「按定义改写」 1. 如果我的宝宝爱我的宝宝，那么我的宝宝就是我。➠ 特例 1. 我的宝宝就是我。➠ 肯定前件的假言推理（modus ponens） 上述演绎「还原」的文字过程，可按照后续章节介绍的谓词逻辑的自然演绎方法表现。设定论域为人，\\(\\mathbf{a}\\) 为「我」，\\(\\mathbf{b}\\) 为「我的宝宝」，\\(Px\\) 表示「\\(x\\) 是人」，\\(Lxy\\) 表示「\\(x\\) 爱 \\(y\\)」，则本例推理过程可表述为（学完相关章节后再阅读这个自然演绎的例子）： natural deduction 当然，这个例子难免让人觉得怪。比较近情理的一个说法是：对于「所有的人都爱我的宝宝」这句话，人们往往不把其中的「所有的人」理解为所有的人，而是理解为宝宝以外的所有人。根据这种说法，从「所有的人都爱我的宝宝」应该得不出「我的宝宝爱我的宝宝」，进而从上述两个前提应该得不出「我的宝宝就是我」这个结论。 「所有的人」的这种「…以外的所有的人」的用法，是个习惯或语境的问题，而非命题的逻辑结构或推理的问题。显然，我们不能说「所有的人」的意思就是「宝宝以外的所有的人」的意思，因为在「所有的人都要睡觉」「所有的人都要吃饭」等句子中，「所有的人」显然不是指宝宝以外的所有的人。当然我们就更不能说「所有的 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)」中的「所有的 \\(S\\)」应理解为宝宝以外的所有的 \\(S\\)。如果把「所有的人都爱我的宝宝」的形式概括为「所有的 \\(S\\) 都与 \\(a\\) 有关系 \\(R\\)」（其中 \\(a\\) 是某个 \\(S\\)，就像我的宝宝是人），那么「所有的 \\(S\\)」在句子中的意思是否就是所有不等于 \\(a\\) 的 \\(S\\) 呢？有些时候是这样，但显然也并不总是这样。 比如，正常人不会认「所有的正整数都大于 1」这一命题是真的，因为正整数 1 不大于 1。然而，假如「所有的正整数」的意思就是所有不等于 1 的正整数，那么我们就必须承认这是个真命题。这样的例子太多了。日常会话中，我们习惯于怎么省事怎么说，「差不多就行」，甚至应该尽可能避免繁琐。但我们谈到理论问题时，「差一点」也不行。上面的例子告诉我们，如果在我们的理论中，我们把下列命题中的「除了 \\(a\\)」漏掉了， 所有的 \\(S\\) 都与 \\(a\\) 有关系 \\(R\\)，除了 \\(a\\). \\(a\\) 是 \\(S\\) 且只与 \\(b\\) 有关系 \\(R\\). 那么「\\(a\\) 就是 \\(b\\)」就成了从我们理论中可以演绎出来的一个结论，尽管我们可能并不想要它。 1.2.2 演绎的例子二 我们来看另一个演绎的例子。据说，有人曾针对古典逻辑（注：「古典逻辑」是狭义的数理逻辑的另一个名字。狭义的数理逻辑包括「四论」（公理集合论、模型论、递归论和证明论），也包括本书讨论的命题逻辑和一阶逻辑等理论。在当代逻辑范围内，古典逻辑范围外，还有众多逻辑分支，俗称「非古典逻辑」。）「从假命题可推出任何命题」这一特点向罗素挑战，要他从「2+2=5」推出「罗素和教皇是同一个人」，罗素当即以下述演绎（或类似的演绎）作出回应： 示例 0.10 1. 2+2=5 ➠ 假设 1. 2=3 ➠ 等词法则（等式两边各减 2） 1. 3=2 ➠ 等词法则（对称性） 1. 2=1 ➠ 等词法则（等式两边各减 1） 1. 罗素和教皇是两个人。 ➠ 事实 1. 罗素和教皇是同一个人。 ➠ 等词法则（运用上述「2=1」） 这个演绎也有点「怪」。上一个例子的前提「所有的人都爱我的宝宝」，虽然未必是真的，但在某些情况下可能是真的，至少我们不知道它是否在任何情况下都是假的。在这个例子中，我们却知道前提「2+2=5」在任何情况下都是假的。演绎和好的论说一样，它并不考虑前提或结论的真假。只要推演规则的选择适当，运用这些规则得到的命题都是前提的逻辑后承，亦即演绎保存真实性。正因如此，演绎不仅仅可以用来（从正面）说明某个命题的真实性，它同样可以用来（从反面）说明某个命题的荒谬性。当然，演绎并不保存荒谬性，可以从荒谬的命题演绎出的不仅仅是荒谬的命题。 1.2.3 可演绎性、可证性和独立性 如果从一集命题（理论、前提或假设）演绎出了某个命题 \\(\\varphi\\)，那么 \\(\\varphi\\) 当然是从这集命题可演绎（deducible）的。从集命题可演绎的常被称为这集命题的演绎后承（deductive consequence）。没有前提的演绎称为证明，无需前提就可演绎的称为可证明的或可证的（provable）。说一个命题是不可证或从给定命题集不可演绎，不是说没有找到它的证明或演绎，而是说不存在这样的证明或演绎。（注：当代逻辑不仅研究某些给定命题是否可证或可演绎，它更系统地研究可证性（可演绎性）和不可证性（不可演绎性）。注意：可证性和可演绎性都是相对于演绎「系统」来谈的。对于不同的演绎「系统」，一个命题是否可证或从一集命题是否可演绎的问题，完全可以有不同的答案。） 独立性就是不可演绎性，只不过它多用于人们感兴趣的命题。一个系统不可证明的命题通常很多，人们不会对所有这些命题都有同样的兴趣。人们有兴趣的命题在一系统中是否不可证，常被称为这些命题的（相对于该系统的）独立性（independence）问题。比如，「独立性」很多时候被用在系统的公理上。给定一个系统和系统中的一个公理 \\(\\varphi\\)。如果从 \\(\\varphi\\) 以外的所有公理经系统的全部推理规则不可证明 \\(\\varphi\\)，那么 \\(\\varphi\\) 就是独立的。换句话说，该系统的全部推理规则和 \\(\\varphi\\) 以外的所有公理构成该系统的一个子系统，而如果 \\(\\varphi\\) 在这个子系统中不可证，我们就称 \\(\\varphi\\) 是独立的（independent）。对于一个系统的公理集合，如果其中每个公理都是独立的，我们就称这个公理集合是独立的。 1.2.4 可演绎性与论说 至此，我们已经初步了解了检验论说好坏的两种基本方法：演绎和对论说形式的检验。这两种方法之间有没有关系呢？ 我们说过，演绎对推演规则的要求是从真命题只能得到真命题。读者可能已经由此猜测：如果从一个论说的前提能够演绎出它的结论，这个论说的形式就是好的。事实上，这个猜测是正确的，而肯定其正确性的定理称为「可靠性定理」。 进一步的问题是，如果从前提演绎不出结论，那是否意味着这个论说的形式一定是不好的呢？或者换个方式来问，如果一个论说的形式是好的，是否一定有一个从它的前提到它的结论的演绎呢？这个命题的答案就本书讨论的演绎系统来说也是肯定的。给出这一问题肯定答案的定理称为「完全性定理」。 演绎和论说虽然关系密切，但它们在某些方面是很不同的。论说的好坏离不开真或假的概念。然而，演绎在一定程度上可以是机械的，与真和假的概念无关。对于确定的公理、假设和推演规则，我们可以逐个去试，看运用每一条公理、假设和规则能得到什么；而只要有足够长的时间和足够大的空间，凡是可演绎出来的命题，我们终究可以找到它的一个演绎。虽然这种办法很笨，而且谁也没有那么多时间把公理、假设和规则一个个地去试；但从理论上说，用这种笨办法总能找到可演绎命题的演绎。这里的关键是：在构造或寻找演绎的过程中，人们可以完全不考虑命题的真假，甚至可以根本没有真和假的观念——他们可以仅仅把规则运用于各个命题，而且在这样运用时又仅仅考察这些命题的形式结构。 1.3 一致性 1.3.1 关于一致性的基本想法 通常，我们可以说某人言行（不）一致，指的是此人说的和做的（不）一样。这和逻辑里说的一致性不同。逻辑里说的一致性（consistency），从直观上说就是不自相矛盾，不自打嘴巴，或者是能说得过去，能自圆其说，或者是相关的各命题可以相安无事，等等。（注：参见 §2.5.3（P.88）中的「可满足性」分析。）也有人把一致性叫作自恰。有时我们也会说一个理论和另一个理论不一致，或一组信念与另一组信念不一致，等等。在这种情况下，我们的意思是说，把这两个理论或这两组信念合在一起就不一致。 很多时候，说一个理论（或一集信念）是一致的，意思是说，在适当的解释下，这个理论中的所有命题都同时是真的；而说一个理论（或一集信念）是不一致的，是说在任何解释下，这个理论中的命题都不会同时是真的。这种一致性的观念是一种「语义」观念，我们可以称它为「语义一致性」。当代逻辑中还有另一种一致性的观念：对于每一个理论，如果从它不能演绎出任何一对矛盾的命题，那么它就是一致的；否则，它就是不一致的。这种一致性的观念是一种「语法」观念，我们可以称它为「语法一致性」。在当代逻辑研究中，「一致性」通常指语法一致性，而语义一致性被称为「可满足性」。 语法一致性和语义一致性有如下关系： 相对于给定的演绎系统，如果语义一致的理论都是语法一致的，那么该系统一定有「可靠性」，亦即从前提可演绎的都是这些前提的逻辑后承。 相对于给定的演绎系统，如果语法一致的理论都是语义一致的，那么该系统一定有「完全性」，亦即只要是前提的逻辑后承都从这些前提可演绎。（注：这一节中有几个命题，其真实性对初学者来说可能不那么明显。我们并不打算在此处详细讨论这些命题，而会在后面讨论它们。所以，即使现在不明白这些命题为什么成立，初学者也不必因此而对逻辑心生畏惧；读完这本讲义后回头来看这些命题时，就会明白它们成立的理由了。） 1.3.2 不一致命题集的例子 一个不一致的命题集合，如果其中的命题比较简单且数量很少，那么它的不一致性通常容易被发现。那些直接包含矛盾的命题集显然是不一致性的。比如： 海德格尔是纳粹。 海德格尔不是纳粹。 在任何解释下，如果这两个命题之一是真的，则另一个不可能是真的；所以任何解释都不能使这集命题同时成立。 在一定预设或直观背景下，有些不一致的命题集虽不是简单地包含一个命题和它的否定，但可以导出一对直接否定对方的命题。比如： 吾盾之坚，物莫能陷也。 吾矛之利，于物无不陷也。 如果那个卖矛和盾的人既有矛 \\(a\\) 又有盾 \\(b\\)，那么由上述言论即可导致「\\(a\\) 不能陷 \\(b\\)」和「\\(a\\) 能陷 \\(b\\)」的矛盾。 有些命题集只含一个命题，但仍能导出矛盾的命题。比如「这位理发师为且只为所有不为自己理发的人理发。（注：这是集合论中罗素悖论的通俗形式，俗称「理发师悖论」。）」通过这个命题我们知道： 这位理发师只为那些不为自己理发的人理发（即不为任何为自己理发的人理发）。 这位理发师为所有不为自己理发的人理发。 这位理发师要么为自己理发要么不为自己理发。但是，如果他为自己理发，那么根据第 0 条他就不为自己理发；而如果他不为自己理发，那么根据第 1 条他就为自己理发。 有些不一致的命题集合，其中任意一对命题都不导致矛盾，甚至去掉其中任何一个命题的结果都是一致的。比如： 示例 0.11 1. 哲学家都是求真的人。 1. 求真的人都不喜欢神侃。 1. 张三是哲学家。 1. 张三喜欢神侃。 请读者检查：这个命题集不一致，尽管从中任选三个命题都一致。 1.3.3 一致性、逻辑蕴涵与可演绎性 理论或信念的一致性和它们的「真实性」或「正确性」是不同的。逻辑学本身不注重其他学科的具体理论或信念的真伪，（注：从某种意义上说，逻辑学非常重视数学理论的真伪，弗雷格和罗素等甚至深信数学可以归结为逻辑。这有点离题了。总之，至少可以说，逻辑学本身不注重逻辑和数学之外的具体理论或信念的真伪。）但注重这些具体理论和信念内部各命题之间的关系，或不同理论、不同信念集合之间的关系；正如逻辑不注重具体论说的前提或结论的真伪，但注重这些前提与结论之间的关系。一个理论或一组信念的一致性，或更一般地，一集命题的一致性，是这集命题为真的必要条件。如果一个理论不一致，那么这个理论的内部有互不相容的命题，而任何一种解释都不能使这个理论中的所有命题同时成立。一个理论或一种信念被人们相信或接受，通常不会仅仅因为它是一致的；但如果它不一致，它就是不可接受的。 一致性与逻辑蕴涵和可演绎性是「相通」的（就本书涉及的系统而言）： 如果一个理论不一致，那么对其中的任何命题，该理论的其他命题一定逻辑蕴涵它的否定。 如果一个理论是一致的，那么对其中的任何命题，该理论的其他命题不会逻辑蕴涵它的否定。 如果一个理论不一致，那么对其中的任何命题，它的否定从该理论的其他命题一定可演绎。 如果一个理论是一致的，那么对其中的任何命题，它的否定从该理论的其他命题一定不可演绎。（注：把一致性理解为语义一致性时，上述第三个命题等价于「完全性定理」，第四个等价于「可靠性定理」；而把一致性理解为语法一致性时，上述第一个命题等价于「可靠性定理」，第二个等价于「完全性定理」（后两个合起来是定理334）。） 为了简单地说明上述命题的意思，我们来看示例 0.11。我们说过，这个「理论」是不一致的。示例 0.11 命题 0 的否定可以从命题 1, 2, 3 演绎出来（或被它们逻辑蕴涵）： 由命题 1, 3 知，张三不是求真的人，再与命题 2 合并，得知张三是哲学家但不是求真的人，进而得到：有些哲学家不是求真的人，即命题 0 的否定。 接下来我们看示例 0.11 中命题 1 的否定可以从命题 0, 2, 3 演绎出来（或被它们逻辑蕴涵）： 由命题 0, 2 知，张三是求真的人，再与命题 3 合并，得知张三既是求真的人又喜欢神侃，进而得到：有些求真的人喜欢神侃，即命题 1 的否定。 至于示例 0.11 中命题 2 的否定和命题 3 的否定是否的确可以分别从其他三条命题演绎出来（或分别被它们逻辑蕴涵），这里就不讨论了，留给读者思考。 1.4 逻辑或「逻辑」的若干问题 近年来，一些与逻辑或「逻辑」有关的谈论实在有些离谱，我们在这里不得不说几句。 1.4.1 「逻辑是什么」不是逻辑问题 在中国，「逻辑是什么」或「什么是逻辑」这类问题谈的特别多，学生们也好奇。一位美国逻辑学家在访问中国期间，曾应邀在某次学术讨论会上做了报告。事后，有一次他和我通电话，谈起那次会议。我问他与会者对他发言的讨论情况，他回答说，没什么逻辑问题，基本上就是问「逻辑是什么」。 学逻辑的人首先应该明白：「逻辑是什么」这类问题都不是逻辑问题。如果我们去上数学课或物理课，或是去读一篇数学论文或物理学论文，老师或作者会在那里大谈数学是什么或物理学是什么吗？不会，至少通常不会。相反，他们会讨论一些具体的数学或物理问题，会告诉我们如何解决这些问题；他们也会讨论一些理论，会告诉我们这些理论如何解决若干类问题。相反，如果我们去上国内流行的哲学课或读一篇哲学论文，遇到对具体哲学问题的讨论的概率几乎就是零。所以，从这样的角度来看，逻辑学像科学（注：本讲义中，「科学」指数学和被称为自然科学的那些学科。我们无意在这里涉及科学哲学中关于数学是否科学的问题，也无意介入对类似问题的讨论。自然，一旦数学是科学，当代逻辑学也应是科学，因为无论是就对象还是就方法而言，当代逻辑学与数学的类似都不亚于任何其他被称为科学的学科。）而不像国内流行的哲学，因为逻辑学研究各种各样的具体的逻辑问题。 「逻辑是什么」这类问题，当然可以讨论。这样的讨论有两种。一是随便谈谈看法，二是认真的学术讨论。如果是随便谈看法，即使是外行来谈，只要谈的不是太离谱人们也不会去较真，因为任何人都可以有自己的看法。（注：“Few men think, yet all will have opinions?” — George Berkeley, Three Dialogues between Hylas and philonous, 1713.）认真的学术讨论则不同，它决不像外行或初学者想像的那么简单，而且即使讨论者的态度是十二分的认真，也未必能使人严肃认真地对待他们的讨论。这是因为，要认真讨论「逻辑是什么」这类问题，首先要熟悉逻辑，要有较全面的学识和较好的修养。倘若只读了几本逻辑教科书，甚至连像样的教课书都没好好读过，那么讨论「逻辑是什么」这类问题是不会得要领的，从而无法指望内行人认真对待这样的讨论。 总有一些人，逻辑没入门，却偏偏热衷于谈论「逻辑是什么」，「逻辑学有多少种」，「逻辑研究有几个层面」和「逻辑学的发展方向」，等等。他们把外行话当「学术论文」写，当「学术报告」讲，甚至不惜误人子弟也要把这些东西炒响做大。真想学点逻辑的人要小心：这些东西只和「逻辑」这个名称有关，和逻辑学的内容不沾边。任何人把自己做的事称作「对科学研究的贡献」，都只是他个人的事；但如果以为只要能炒响做大，内行们就不得不认真对待，甚至不得不承认，那才是典型的科学外行的一厢情愿。 1.4.2 逻辑与「逻辑」的用法 有「专家」说，要想确定逻辑是什么，就要看历史上和现实中人们怎么用「逻辑」这个词，并声称只有这样得出的看法才是「客观的」。于是，经过对「逻辑」用法的一番「考察」得出结论：逻辑除亚里士多德逻辑、数理逻辑和概率逻辑，还有方法论和知识论、非形式逻辑和辩证逻辑，共有五六种。 按说，当「专家」一本正经地谈「学术」时，总不至于信口开河；可我们的「专家」实在不争气。单看结论就已令人大跌眼镜，因为仅凭常识也知道「逻辑」的用法远不止这五六种。 用 google 搜索一下就有以下结果：当代逻辑（数理逻辑、古典逻辑、哲学逻辑、非古典逻辑）、形式逻辑、归纳逻辑、概率逻辑、传统逻辑、发现的逻辑、辩证逻辑、非形式逻辑、自然语言逻辑、模糊逻辑、人工智能逻辑、中国古代逻辑、法律逻辑、经济逻辑、商业逻辑、商务逻辑、资本逻辑、营销逻辑、地产逻辑、自然逻辑、人文逻辑、社会逻辑、教育逻辑、文学逻辑、历史逻辑、艺术逻辑、审美逻辑、男性逻辑、女性逻辑、愤青逻辑、痴呆逻辑、行政逻辑、和谐逻辑、创新逻辑、文化逻辑、潜逻辑、足球逻辑、致富逻辑、运气逻辑、统治逻辑、专制逻辑、官场逻辑、官僚逻辑、升官逻辑、军阀逻辑、土匪逻辑、强盗逻辑、流氓逻辑、痞子逻辑、骗子逻辑、厕所逻辑，等等。 「逻辑」的诸多用法显然无法对应于「专家」说的那五六种逻辑，这一事实不仅无法否认，而且与「专家」的前提和结论无法同世而立。所以，如果我们的「专家」不肯放弃他的前提或结论，那就只会让自己落到全无逻辑的地步。（这也是「逻辑」的一种用法!） 外行人如何使用「逻辑」这个词，逻辑学者通常没必要认真，因为「逻辑」这个词早被人们或有意或无意地滥用，在很多情况下与作为一个学科的逻辑学没什么关系，正像「科学」这个词的很多用法与科学没什么关系一样。按说，内行人不在乎外行人对他们的学科怎么说一一科学家不在乎哲学家怎么定义科学就是很好的说明；那么，我们的「逻辑专家」在界定逻辑学时，何以恰恰相反，求助于外行关于「逻辑」的说法呢？套用一句话：这种人其实是外行，或者装作是外行。（二狗曰：「逻辑」有很多种，「逻辑学」也有很多种。） 1.4.3 逻辑与「习惯的说理方式」 地球是否围绕着太阳转？每个大于 1 的自然数是否都是某些素数的积？这些科学问题的答案和人们的习惯看法无关。同样地，从「如果 \\(\\varphi\\) 则 \\(\\chi\\)」和「如果 \\(\\psi\\) 则 \\(\\chi\\)」是否可推出「如果 \\(\\varphi\\) 或 \\(\\psi\\) 那么 \\(\\chi\\)」，也和人们的说理习惯无关。逻辑区分好的说理和坏的说理，但不以人们习惯的说理方式为根据。 记得曾有人主张「有些 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)」蕴涵「有些 \\(S\\) 不是 \\(P\\)」，理由就是人们常这样说理，比如从「有些学生迟到了」推岀「有些同学没迟到」，等等。令人费解的是，这些人大都承认，从「所有 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)」可以「合理地」推出「有些 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)」（假定说「所有\\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)」时总有 \\(S\\) 存在），却看不出这样一来，从「所有 \\(S\\) 是 \\(P\\)」就可以「合理地」推出「有些 \\(S\\) 不是 \\(P\\)」，于是可以「合理地」推出逻辑矛盾。把习惯的说理方式看作合理的说理方式，其结果只会是混乱。 近来更有人把文化问题装扮成科学问题，宣称存在不同的逻辑，其理由是不同文化中人们有不同的说理方式和习惯。按照这种人的说法，不仅中国人的说理方式和习惯与西方人的不同，汉族的说理方式和习惯与其他民族的也不同；所以中国有中国的逻辑，西方有西方的逻辑；汉族有汉族的逻辑，其他民族有其他民族的逻辑。同时，为了表明这种「理论研究」有社会效益，还特意为它插上「有助于各民族的相互了解」和「有利于社会发展」的标签。 不同文化中，人们的确可以有不同的说理方式和习惯；但同一个文化中，人们照样可以有不同的说理方式和习惯。倘若说理方式和习惯的不同真能说明存在不同的逻辑，那么，岂止是各国可以有各国的逻辑，或各民族可以有各民族的逻辑？各地区也可以有各地区的逻辑，各校又可以有各校的逻辑，甚至个人还可以有个人的逻辑——谁没有自己的说理方式和习惯呢？这世界上有一类人，他们习惯的说理方式是「空着肚子说气壮的话」，以自称「永远不会错」为这类气壮话的典型。这能否说明存在一种与之相应的「逻辑」，进而也该对它做一番「研究」呢？ 假如今天哪个文化圈里的人习惯地认为圆周率是 3，或习惯地认为一万乘以一万就是无穷，那么头脑正常的人不会因此而声称存在不同的数学。假如昨天发现了某个远离现代社会的原始部落，那里的人都习惯地认为太阳绕着地球转，或认为人是猫变来的，那么头脑正常的人也不会因此而声称存在不同的物理学或生物学。偏偏中国的哲学和逻辑学先天不足，后天失调，「不同说理方式和习惯导致不同逻辑」这类昏话，竟也可以被称作学术研究而登堂入室。 1.4.4 当代逻辑、传统逻辑和「普通人需要的逻辑」 这门课叫「符号逻辑」，取这个名字只是为区别于其他逻辑课程，如「数理逻辑」等；但这些课程名称的不同，并不意味着符号逻辑和数理逻辑是不同的逻辑。在国际主流逻辑学界，「符号逻辑」「数理逻辑」「形式逻辑」「当代逻辑」通常都是指同一个东西。 传统的形式逻辑（在国内曾被称为「形式逻辑」，现在多被称为「普通逻辑」或「传统逻辑」）是幼年的形式逻辑，它从根本上说只构成当代逻辑的一个很小的部分。尽管幼年的形式逻辑在人类文明史上有着不可磨灭的贡献，但随着科学的发展，它提供的逻辑观念、理论和工具，相对于科学（尤其是数学）研究的需要来说，显得越来越贫乏，越来越不足道。自弗雷格以来的当代逻辑，无论是就基础的坚实还是就方法的完善来讲，都大大超过了幼年的形式逻辑；而更重要的是，从当代逻辑研究中产生的新观念和发现的新规律，为科学的发展提供了更好的逻辑理论和工具。［Tarski,1941］用 20 世纪最杰出的逻辑学家哥德尔的话说： 数理逻辑不是别的，就是形式逻辑的准确和完备的表述。它有很不同的两面。一方面，它是数学的一个部门，处理着类、关系、符号组合等等，而不是数、函数、几何图形等等。另一方面，它是先于一切科学的一门科学，包含着位于一切科学底层的观念和原理。［Gödel,1944］ 有些人总在抱怨：当代逻辑太技术化，太专业化了，越来越不适宜满足日常思维的实际需求。他们举出很多当代逻辑不考虑普通人需求的证据，如形式语言和数学方法等，还有很多当代逻辑课不受普通学生欢迎的故事。有些人甚至声称，数理逻辑的纯技术化和数学化发展，已经在某种程度上对逻辑的存在构成了威胁。于是他们主张搞一种源于传统逻辑而又适应普通人思维实际需要的「新逻辑」，称之为「批判性思维」或「非形式逻辑」。 「批判性思维」之类的东西，作为一种初级逻辑的教学模式，或者作为关于初级逻辑的普及和日常应用的探索，是值得鼓励的。在美国不少大学，「逻辑导论」课是通选课，虽俗称「baby logic」，但仍有不少学生难以过关；而「批判性思维」课（如果有的话），俗称「baby baby logic」，就是专为这些学生开设的。国内不少学生甚至学者在逻辑性方面的欠缺是严重的，而普通的「逻辑导论」课又似乎对他们帮助不大；因而就逻辑的教学和普及而言，我赞成借鉴甚至进口「批判性思维」这类课程。（二狗曰：批判性思维：foetus logic；逻辑导论：baby logic；经典数理逻辑：basic logic.）但是，就逻辑理论而言，「新逻辑」并不是新逻辑，因为无论人们的愿望是什么，它尚未提供能与当代逻辑理论相比的逻辑理论。 初级逻辑的普及和日常应用问题，甚至当代逻辑的应用问题，都可以讨论甚至应该重视；但面向大众的逻辑课是一回事，逻辑理论研究是另一回事。这问题本来很简单，就像文科学生的数学课，总不能和数学系的课一模一样；但这决不意味着「文科数学」是有别于主流数学的另一种数学。其实，即使从应用角度来说，当代逻辑的主要目标也是为理论研究、尤其是科学理论研究提供更好的逻辑理论和工具——它早已远远超出了「满足普通人日常需要」的眼界。在这方面，逻辑学和其他科学一样，其理论研究结果应该不是普通人一看就懂且马上能用的。在科学的实际应用方面，普通人包括学生大概都有发言权；但倘若评价科学理论要以外行的好恶为标准，科学理论问题要靠他们投票来解决，那么科学就不再是科学了。 当代逻辑学家既不拒绝对新问题的探讨，也不拒绝对现有理论的重新思考。惟其如此，才会出现众多的所谓新逻辑。不过，新逻辑的出现，不是靠拒绝当代逻辑的基本思想和方法，更不是靠知难而退式的「另起炉灶」。恰恰相反，这些新逻辑都是运用当代逻辑基本思想和方法的产物，进而逐步成为当代逻辑的新分支。（注：这些分支数量之多，已使精通所有分支的「全才」成为「历史人物」。十多年前去世的 A. Church 传说是最后一位「所有逻辑文章的评审员」，而这种说法显然不是针对晚年的 Church 来说的。）任何人想再搞一套逻辑都可以，但要拿出能与主流理论竞争的理论。当真要竞争，总不能比对手差太远，起码要知道对手做什么，而不能像某些「\\(X\\) 科学」的鼓吹者那样，对真正的科学一知半解，且所谓「竞争」也只限于对主流科学界的抱怨和基于非科学评价的煽情。 和任何科学一样，逻辑学研究有大量人的参与。随着学科的快速发展，除非是天才，不学习就要落后，落后严重的就会变成外行。说白了，即便是亚里士多德再世，如果他既不学当代逻辑又只能做他两千年前做出的工作，那么他也只是个亚氏逻辑专家，而不是当代的逻辑学家。这样说似乎对亚氏不敬，但逻辑学科的发展和进步使亚式逻辑成为历史却是事实。今天，只懂得毕达哥拉斯时代的数学的人不会被称为数学家，只懂得牛顿时代的物理学的人也不会被称为物理学家。根据同样的道理，只懂得亚式逻辑的人，不会是当代的逻辑学家。如今，想要成为逻辑学内行，学习当代逻辑是必由之路；而若想和当代逻辑竞争，学懂当代逻辑更是必要条件。 当代逻辑有很多分支，研究者文理各科都有，研究兴趣也不一样；但有一点是相同的，即都用形式语言和数学方法讨论逻辑问题。对当代逻辑专业化和技术化的抱怨，主要是针对这种形式语言和数学方法的抱怨。 弗雷格曾把他的概念文字与日常语言的关系比作显微镜与眼睛的关系。［Frege,1879］眼睛的适用范围和适应环境的灵活性远远高于显微镜，然而，一旦科学研究需要更敏锐的分辨能力，眼睛就立刻让位于显微镜。尽管后者在满足普通人的实际需要方面毫无用武之地，但它不应因此而受到指责。研究方法上的改进推动科学的进步，甚至比孤立的个别发现更加重要，这在科学界已是共识。恰恰是形式语言和数学方法的运用，使人们对真假、逻辑蕴涵、演绎、证明、一致性和公理系统等的认识有了空前的提高，也使逻辑学最终走出了它的幼年时期而与其他科学站到了一起，并为其他科学的理论研究提供了大量的逻辑理论和工具。在这种情况下，抱怨形式语言和数学方法不满足日常思维的需求，就像抱怨显微镜无助于提高普通人对日常现象的观察能力；这不仅不得要领，更清楚地表明抱怨者没有跟上逻辑学科的发展，其「逻辑观」还停留在弗雷格之前的某个年代。 当然，这并不是说当代逻辑对普通人的工作和生活完全没有影响。与各种科学理论研究一样，当代逻辑要绕很多弯子才能与普通人联系上。比如，我们都知道，个人电脑和计算机网络对普通人工作和生活的影响越来越大；而当代逻辑通过个人电脑和计算机网络就联系到我们的工作和生活，只不过要兜个圈子：它先联系到计算机科学，再经后者的理论研究联系到它的应用研究和技术研究，最后再经过具体硬件和软件的开发、生产和销售等中介，才联系到个人电脑和计算机网络，才联系到我们的工作和生活。尽管当代逻辑是计算机科学的基础理论之一，但使用个人电脑和计算机网络的普通人，却不需要懂当代逻辑（即使普通的程序员也不需要懂多少）。科学就是这样：它不要求所有的人都懂，却可以使所有的人受益。 如果读者愿意学点当代逻辑，又做好了克服困难的思想准备，那么我们的「逻辑旅程」就可以开始了。不过，当代逻辑从弗雷格算起虽只有一百多年时间，但内容丰富，分支很多，而且发展很快。读者在这里能够看到的，只是它最浅显的一部分。这份讲义虽然长达几百页，一旦学懂了，大概就只剩几十页了。 Editorial comments If you have a GitHub account and want to make any editorial suggestions, please do so here.

That’s logic.’ —Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass Logic is the formal study of reasoning – the attempt to justify or provide evidence for claims or beliefs. In this chapter we will look at the basic concepts and techniques for the logical analysis of arguments. As we will be seeing this will be useful in our discussions of ethics since much of what we will be doing will involve careful consideration of the justification of claims we make about ethics in general as well as particular topics in ethics. Before we get started though we need to clarify some terminology – especially our use of the word “argument.” Too often this word conjures up a pointless verbal fight between people with opposed views. They argue rather than discuss because their differences of opinion are fixed in place and neither will budge. It is typically a good idea to stay away from arguments in this sense. The word argument as we are using it here, however, has quite a different meaning. For us arguments do not require differences of opinion because arguments are just attempts to explicitly provide back-up or justification for some claim that we might make. We offer arguments in this sense whenever we make the grounds for our belief explicit whether we are doing this within the confines of our own heads, in written form or spoken out loud, and whether or not anyone disagrees with us. Arguments in this sense of the term might appear in regular old verbal disputes. But as we will be seeing, arguments are best looked at one at a time since each one stands or falls on its own merits. So, for philosophers, arguments are just attempts to provide support for whatever it is that we might claim is true. For example, maybe we think the death penalty is wrong, or the opposite, so we come up with an argument to show this. Or maybe we think that morality is a sham, nothing but a cover story for basically selfish motives. Once again, we can come up with an argument in support of this idea. Or on an even more abstract level we might think that moral judgments are just matters of opinion and that it is therefore a waste of time to even argue about what is right and what is wrong. Since none of these claims are self-evidently true (even though some people may think some of these are obvious) we’ll need an argument to back them up, or at least to make explicit our reasons for making these claims. In the end, we can think whatever we want. That will, however, only get us so far – either others will agree with us or not, and either our thoughts will be true or not. But we can also offer reasons in support of our claims in the form of arguments. As we will be seeing, not all arguments are equally persuasive. There are, however, clear-cut and reliable ways of evaluating them to see which really provide the support we are after and which do not. 2.1 Arguments, Rationality and Rhetoric Arguments can of course be looked at as attempts to persuade other people that they should accept the claims that we are making. Because of this it may seem at first glance to be similar to rhetoric, also known as “the art of persuasion.” People who study and practice rhetoric often claim that rational argument is just one among many different methods of persuasion, appropriate at specific times, but not fundamentally different than other methods. That is, they claim that argument is a form of rhetoric. Philosophers, on the other hand, would like to insist on the basic difference between the two. Philosophers call attention to the fact that in rhetoric: Appeal is made to our emotions, prejudices, fears, hopes, etc. That is, who we are and what we feel about things matters. This is both its strength and its weakness. Because of this, the persuasion that rhetoric produces doesn’t last, once our feelings change, we are no longer convinced, and our feelings are constantly changing. In rational argument, on the other hand: Appeal is made not to our emotions but to our ability to reason. Since everyone is equally capable of reasoning, this means that arguments do not appeal to us personally. It doesn’t matter who you are, a good argument should convince you. 2.2 The Structure of Arguments To see all of this more clearly, we need to take a look at how arguments work. But first things first – we need a more precise definition of what we mean by an argument in the first place. That’s easy enough: An argument is a series of statements where some of these statements are intended to provide evidence or support for others. When we argue we are attempting to establish some claims on the basis of other claims. As sets of statements, arguments involve the declarative use of language. Declarative statements (or propositions) are just sentences that state stuff, they make claims, and so they can be either true or false. So when we are looking at arguments we are deliberately ignoring the many other ways we can use language, such as asking questions, making commands, expressing feelings. When we are offering an argument we are making a series of claims in which some are supposed to provide support for others. The statements that are doing the supporting are known as premises. The statement that is being supported, the point of our argument is called the conclusion. It is, however, sometimes difficult to tell whether a set of sentences is an argument or not. Let us consider a few examples: Parents should have the right to make decisions about their own children’s healthcare. Why should other people mess around in their business? And please, let’s keep the lawyers out! This may seem like an argument, so how can we tell for sure? Simply by checking whether this set of sentences is a set of statements where some are intended to provide support for others. So, how many statements are there here? Only one: the first sentence is a statement, the second is a question and the third is a command. In other words, even though this looks at first like an argument it is really just a single claim with no real argument given in support. What about the next example? How many statements are in these sentences? And do any of them really offer support for any of the others? I am convinced that aliens are living among us and you should be convinced as well. I have really good evidence for this claim. Well this is almost an argument, but not quite. There is a claim being made here: aliens are living among us. But there is no real support given for this claim, only the insistence that this person has some unknown evidence. Before we can start to evaluate this evidence to see whether it really supports the claim, we need to see it. So here we have only two separate statements without a real argument yet. Now consider the following example: Christopher Columbus was a criminal, because anyone who kills innocent people, kidnaps others, and steals their valuables is a criminal and that is just what he did. Here the grammatical form is a little misleading. This is an argument in spite of the fact that there is only one sentence. Why? Because this one sentence expresses a few different claims or propositions and some of these claims are offered as supports for others. We can see this if we break it up into individual claims and change the order around like so into standard form with the premises listed as individual statements and the conclusion written last. Anyone who kills people, kidnaps other people and steals their valuables is a criminal. Christopher Columbus did all of those things. So Christopher Columbus was a criminal. Perhaps this is not yet a very convincing or complete argument, but at least it is an argument unlike the first examples. It is not always so clear which statements in an argument are the premises and which statement is the conclusion. Often, but not always, these are signaled with one of a number of typical words or phrases that function as premise or conclusion indicators. Paying attention to these typical words and phrases can help you to disentangle the argument from the peculiarities of a writer’s style. 2.2.1 Premises To help guide us through an argument a writer or speaker who is presenting an argument might use the following expressions and phrases to show what the argument rests on. These are premise indicators. Because Since In light of the fact that In view of the following evidence This is not an exhaustive list. Basically, when reading an argument you can pick out the premises by asking yourself where the writer is starting from and where he or she is going. The first is the set of premises and the second is the conclusion. 2.2.2 Conclusions It is often the case that arguments are presented with the conclusion first in order to emphasize where the discussion is supposed to be going. The following common words are often used to indicate a statement that is supposed to play the logical role of the conclusion of an argument. Therefore It follows that Thus It should be clear that These words and phrases indicate that this is where the writer (or speaker) is going with the argument and they are often used at the beginning of an informal argument to orient us, even though logically speaking they are last. For example, when a lawyer begins her argument in court with the claim, “Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client is not guilty,” and then goes on to present the evidence, she is reversing the logical order for rhetorical effect. This is fine in everyday life, but since it can be confusing, when we look at arguments explicitly here we will look at them in standard form with the premises first and conclusion last. 2.2.3 Pattern of reasoning One other thing to watch for when looking at arguments is words and phrases that indicate the structure of the reasoning itself. These are ways of pointing out exactly how the premises are supposed to support the conclusion, and so are indicators of the pattern or form of reasoning involved. Some examples are: Because of these, that has to be true. If this then that, otherwise this. All of the above is true so this means… This is the only option that makes sense. If we assume that this is true we get a ridiculous result so it can’t be true. These indicate the general logic form of argument being followed. Is it a matter of necessity, other conditions present or absent, summation of influences, or a process of elimination, or are we showing something indirectly by showing that denying it makes no sense? The more formal study of logic looks carefully at these and many other different patterns of reasoning, and we will meet them at various points in our discussions of arguments about topics in ethics. 2.3 Validity and Soundness Being rational is nothing more than trying to follow two basic rules. Have good reasons for your fundamental beliefs. Don’t just repeat them because you have heard them, but own them because you have thought them through and they seem to present a defensible picture of how things should be. Adjust your theories to the evidence. NOT the other way around! Theories are nothing but models that help us see what might happen next. If our theories keep telling us that something will happen and it doesn’t so much the worse for the theory. Well established theories have both a cogent theoretical story to tell, but also mesh with the facts on the ground. Because of this they can help guide us through our lives. Bad theories that fail either on the theoretical or empirical side, are no better than guesses. Not all arguments, however, are really equal. Just having any old argument won’t always get us very far. Instead, as we will see, there are some arguments that really are better than others. This was the insight of the first philosophers in the Western tradition, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and it does seem kind of strange that I feel compelled to have to justify it even after a couple of thousand years. Way back then, just like now, many people thought this was a presumptuous claim to make. This is especially the case since it amounts to the claim that some arguments are really compelling on their own, and that we should, as long as we are being rational, have no choice but to accept them. For the skeptics out there who doubt that we will ever be able to create such an argument, I should also point out that the clearest and best arguments really don’t end up saying anything very controversial or extraordinary. This is one of the limitations that logic imposes on us: if we are really being logical and using only reliable arguments we may have to refrain from claiming to be able to establish very much. Understanding the logic of arguments, if nothing else, should encourage us to be a little more modest in our claims to knowledge. And this is why Socrates, in spite of his reputation for being a bit of a jerk in pointing out to many people the flaws in their own arguments is today most well known for saying that the only thing he really knew what how little he knew. To get back to business, when we are arguing what we are doing is trying to establish the truth of something that we don’t know on the basis of other things that we already know or accept. What we are interested in is establishing the truth of the conclusion, yet for some reason it’s truth is not obviously apparent to us so we need to establish it on the basis of other claims the truth of which we can already accept. Arguments move us from the known to the unknown. To take a simple example, suppose we would like to establish that Socrates fears death. We don’t have any direct reason for thinking that this is true. But we do know some other things that may be of use in establishing this. First we know that Socrates is a human being. Second we know that all human beings are mortal. Third, we know that all mortals fear death. In standard form this would be arranged like so: Socrates is a human being. All human beings are mortal. All mortals fear death. So Socrates fears death. This is a bit of a contrived example, but it can help us to see the key concepts we can use to evaluate any argument at all. 2.3.1 Key concepts The information in the premises is enough information, as we can easily see, to establish our conclusion. Since Socrates is human he must be mortal, and he must fear death, since all mortals fear death. This argument seems like a pretty solid piece of reasoning. But how can we tell in general whether an argument is a good argument? It turns out that there are two questions we will need to ask about an argument in order to determine whether or not it is a good argument: Is there a clear and solid connection between every step of the reasoning that leads us inevitably from premises to conclusion? In philosophical terminology: is it valid? Are the claims that we started from, our premises, really true? In philosophical terminology: is it sound? How do we answer these questions for the example above? It seems that there is in fact a clear and solid connection between what the premises are saying and what the conclusion is saying. In fact we already showed this above when showed that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Technically this is a short and informal proof of its strength as an argument, that is, of its validity. So the answer to the first question is, yes, it is valid. As far as the second question goes, however, we may have our doubts. Are all of the premises really true? Socrates is (or was) a human being – he was one of the first philosophers. And all human beings are in fact mortal, at least as far as the evidence we have goes. But do we really know whether all mortals, past, present and future fear death? So here is the one small weakness of the argument. If we could be assured that this premise was true the argument would be completely convincing and would provide adequate backup for the conclusion. But it rests, unfortunately, on a weak premise, so it is not a sound argument. Since these two ideas are both very important for everything we’ll be doing here and not so obviously obvious, here are some more explicit definitions: The best arguments must be both valid and sound. Validity: in a valid argument IF the premises are true the conclusion MUST also be true. Soundness: A sound argument is a valid argument that also has TRUE premises. One thing to notice here is that the test for validity is entirely independent of the test for soundness. It is a little misleading, as we can now see, to ask whether arguments are either good or bad. More precisely, they can be: Valid and sound: these are the best arguments, because the premises really establish the conclusion, and the premises are true – hence the conclusion really is true. Valid but not sound: these are promising arguments that exhibit good logical form, but that rely on less than perfect information in their premises, and so are not completely solid. Invalid: these arguments are bad arguments since they do not establish what they claim to be establishing. All invalid arguments are automatically unsound, since sound arguments are a subset of valid arguments. 2.3.2 More examples Theoretical and Empirical Claims Complex arguments about moral issues typically have two primary kinds of support, theoretical claims and empirical claims. Theoretical Claims are premises that spell out the bigger picture about how we are looking at things. These can range from explicit statements of methodology and scientific support to implicit ideological frameworks and assumptions. Empirical Claims are factual claims on which the application of our theory to reality rests. If our theory says that this economic policy will cause that change in unemployment rates and it consistently doesn’t happen that way, we have a flawed theory. So empirical claims are where we provide evidence that shows as much as we can how it is that our theory makes a difference in reality. This is an important part of moral argument as well since it is often the case that our ideas about morality depend on our ideas about what humans really do in certain kinds of cases, so we should at least get that right. Learning how to identify valid arguments is important for a course in philosophical ethics, since the philosophical approach to ethics consists largely of the examination of arguments about ethical issues. And the best way to learn this is by practicing. Consider the following argument, conveniently written in standard form: The earth is a rotating sphere moving around the sun. We are all on the surface of the earth. Anything on the surface of a moving object moves with that object. So we are all moving around the sun. Forget for a moment about whether or not you buy the conclusion on its own. In analyzing an argument we need to know whether the premises support the conclusion adequately, so we pretend that we are not sure about the truth of the conclusion. Our first test is the test of validity. We ask ourselves: if the premises were true, could the conclusion be otherwise? Is the truth of the conclusion guaranteed by the truth of the premises? In this case it seems clear that if we are in fact all on the surface of an object that is moving around the sun, then we would all also have to be moving around the sun. So the argument is valid. Notice that establishing an argument’s validity is not yet establishing that the conclusion is really true. It is only establishing that the conclusion would be true, if only we could show that the premises were true. In fact this argument was rejected until about 500 years ago because nobody was willing to accept the truth of the first premise. Establishing that this was true took quite a bit of effort by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and other early modern scientists. However, we now know that the premises are true. So this argument is not only valid, but also sound. And since it is sound we have proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that the conclusion is true. One more thing to point out here is that this argument has always been sound (or at least as long as the solar system has existed) even if many people denied the truth of the first premise. They were simply mistaken in this denial. Let’s look at another example: If you want to see the world, you should join the navy. Jane wants to see the world. So Jane should join the navy. This argument is a little trickier because it contains an If … then statement. If … then statements, also known as conditionals, make indirect claims. They don’t just tell us what is the case, they tell us what would be the case if, or on condition that, something else were true. With this in mind let us consider this second argument. First we check for validity, by assuming that the premises are true and seeing if the conclusion would have to be true as well. In other words we are not yet interested in whether or not they really are true, but whether the argument works as an argument, whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. It seems pretty clear that this argument is valid. This is because if, as the first premise claims, the navy really is the best way to see the world, and if as the second premise claims, a person named Jane wants to see the world, then she should clearly join the navy. Notice that this argument’s validity does not have anything to do with its content, with the particular claims being made. Instead, validity is a matter of form, so that we could substitute any other content for the content of this argument without affecting its validity. Essentially this argument has the following form: If A, then B. A. Therefore B. Here A, B can be substituted by any statements we please, as long as our substitution is consistent throughout the argument. In all cases the resulting argument will turn out to be valid. Try it and you will see that the resulting arguments all come out valid. This is because validity is a matter of logical form regardless of the content we are arguing about. The soundness of arguments, however, unlike validity, has everything to do with content, because an argument is sound when it is valid and it also has true premises. Back to the argument about Jane. Is it sound? First we note that it is valid, then we ask whether or not the premises are really true. Consider the first premise: “If you want to see the world you should join the navy.” It may be true that joining the navy is one way to see the world (provided that you don’t end up on a submarine, or in the engine room of a ship), but is it the only way? Of course not, so the first premise is just false. The second premise is also questionable, but for a different reason – we simply do not know who Jane is since this is a fictional example. So in spite of its validity this argument is unsound and we need not accept the conclusion as a true statement. It may in fact be true, but this argument gives us no good reason for thinking so. As an exercise you might want to try coming up with a sound argument that follows the form of this one. Now consider as our next example, the following argument: If you want to see the world, you should join the navy. Jane joined the navy. So Jane wants to see the world. This argument seems similar to the previous one, but it has one important difference. The conclusion of this argument was the second premise of the last argument, and the second premise of this argument was its conclusion. What happens to the validity of the argument when we make this simple change? Notice what this argument is saying. It is offering an explanation of why it is that Jane joined the navy – because she wanted to see the world. The question is, and this is the way we check for validity, are there any other possible explanations of why she joined the navy that are consistent with the premises? In other words, is it possible for the premises to both be true and the conclusion false? The answer is yes. It all hinges on what the first premise doesn’t say. It doesn’t say that the only possible reason to join the navy is the desire to see the world. It just says that if that’s what you happen to want then the navy is for you. So Jane could have joined the navy only because she wanted to learn all there is to know about marine diesel engines without caring whether she learned this in New Jersey or in the South Pacific ocean. To put this in yet another way: if it is at all possible, if there are no contradictions involved, for the premises of an argument to be true and the conclusion false, then the argument is invalid. This argument is invalid for precisely this reason. Furthermore, since it is invalid, this automatically makes it unsound, since in order for it to be sound it has to first be valid. 2.4 Proofs and Counterexamples Another way to look at the difference between valid and invalid arguments is in terms of the difference between a proof and a counterexample. A proof is a step by step demonstration that the conclusion is a necessary consequence of the premises. To prove that a conclusion validly follows from a set of premises we show in a detailed way how a series of obviously valid steps in reasoning lead us to the conclusion. Take the following argument for example. Fred is older than Wilma but younger than Betty. Barney is older than Betty. So Barney is older than Fred. Remember that a valid argument is one in which if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. So how would we prove that this is the case? Well we just assume that the premises are true and go from there. So here is what a proof might look like: The first premise states that Fred is older than Wilma and he is younger than Betty. Wilma doesn’t matter here since she isn’t mentioned in the other premise or the conclusion, so let’s just note that this premise clearly states that Fred is younger than Betty. Now this would mean that Betty is older than Fred, since “older” and “younger” are inverses. If I am younger than you then you are older than me no matter who we are since that’s what “younger” and “older” mean. Now since Barney is older than Betty, as the second premise states, he must be older than Fred too, since as we just saw, Betty is older than Fred. This follows from the fact that the relationship “older than” is a transitive relationship – if A is older than B and B is older than C A has to be older than C since that’s “just what”older than\" means. So our conclusion that Barney is older than Fred is clearly a logical consequence of the premises. That’s all there really is to any proof. We have just unpacked the meaning of what the premises are saying in a way that establishes that they entail the conclusion. We don’t, in other words, have to add any new information to what is already stated in the premises in order to get the conclusion. In more complicated cases it can take much more effort to show this but all proofs are nothing but such a process of showing that the conclusion is thus “contained” in the premises already, which is of course why the truth of the premises would guarantee the truth of the conclusion. In a simple case like this we can almost just see the obviousness of the connection between premises and conclusion, and so it might seem silly to spell things out in this much detail, but in more complicated cases there is more room for error so spelling things out like this is important. Invalid arguments in contrast are arguments where we would need something more than what is contained in the premises to get the conclusion. No matter how we attempt to prove our conclusion we will always come to some spot where we cannot get any closer to the conclusion. So how do we show this? We use a counterexample, which is nothing but a possible situation in which the premises would all be true and the conclusion would be false. This shows that the argument is invalid, since if it were valid it would be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false at the same time as we just saw. Consider the following argument: Fred is older than Wilma but younger than Betty. Barney is younger than Betty and older than Wilma. So Fred is older than Barney. Even though we have no idea what these peoples’ ages are (or even if they exist outside of a 1970’s TV cartoon series) we can tell that the conclusion does not have to be true, even if the premises were true. This argument is invalid and we can show this with a counterexample. person age Barney 36 Betty 40 Fred 35 Wilma 32 Notice that if these people had these ages, this would make all of the premises true and the conclusion false. If Fred is 35, Wilma is 32, Betty is 40 and Barney is 36, then it is true that Fred is older than Wilma, but younger than Betty – which is what the first premise claims. It is also true that, given these ages, Barney is younger than Betty and older than Wilma – which is what the second premise claims. But Fred is not older than Barney. In other words, what these ages show that it is possible for the premises to be true and for the conclusion to be false and thus that the reasoning involved in getting to the conclusion is invalid. Even if we had true premises, this would not be enough to guarantee the truth of the conclusion. That is what terrible reasoning is all about. We will many more examples of bad reasoning in the next chapter on logical fallacies. 2.5 Slideshow Summary download print new tab 2.6 📺 What is Critical Thinking? What is critical thinking anyway?

As we saw in the last chapter, there is something to be said for being logical. Put simply, valid and sound reasoning really just boils down to not saying more than you really know and this seems like a pretty reasonable approach if we want to figure out what is true and what is not. It is, however, abundantly clear that us humans often fail to abide by this principle and make claims that we really don’t have much support for. This chapter explores two related ways we do this – by committing fallacies and by getting caught by various “cognitive illusions.” Fallacies are bad arguments – they are typically invalid – that are often used to try to convince someone of some point that really has little argumentative support. They work, to the extent that they do, because they take advantage of certain weaknesses in our reasoning skills. As we will be seeing, a careful analysis of how various different forms of fallacious reasoning work and of what mistakes they make can provide us with a certain degree of protection from those who would use them to convince us of things that have little real support. Cognitive illusions are related in that they lead to mistakes in reasoning, but they are often more difficult to spot and avoid falling prey to, since they are mistakes rooted in mental shortcuts that can be reliable in certain contexts. Like visual illusions, they are false representations of reality, which, even if we know they are false, we cannot help falling prey to. Looking at some common cognitive illusions can help us to see, however, why we should sometimes not trust our own thought processes as much as we often do. And this as well can provide us with more tools for distinguishing between between what is really the case and what just seems to be so. As we turn to examine some important logical fallacies it is helpful to keep in mind that there are both many more particular fallacies than the ones we are going to look at and also many different ways of categorizing them. The thing to keep in mind here is that all stretch logical support beyond its breaking point, and how in particular this happens is not always so clear. On the other hand you can usually see the weakness of an argument that relies on a fallacy by asking yourself a simple question about it: What is being claimed here, and on the basis of what? This often reveals the basic weakness of the argument as it involves stepping back from the particular claims being made in order to see the broader pattern and strategy of reasoning involved. It is this pattern that is flawed, regardless of the content of the argument. As a result, we can often find instances of the same form of fallacious reasoning used with many different topics, especially those that are controversial. In addition it can be helpful to look at fallacies in terms of a few more general types of mistakes in reasoning. That is what we will do here as we examine some different forms of bad reasoning under the headings: fallacies of relevance all of which depend on premises not relevant to the conclusion; fallacies of ambiguity all of which depend on the ways in which many words and expressions can have multiple and often incompatible meanings; and fallacies of presumption,\" which depend on unacknowledged, unjustified extra assumptions. 3.1 Fallacies of Relevance As we turn to the fallacies of relevance, it is good to remember these fallacies depend on the use of information that may seem relevant to establishing the conclusion but isn’t really relevant after all. They often play on our emotional responses to certain situations and topics and they can be quite effective as means of persuading us. They work so well in getting us to buy into their conclusions in part because of the nature of the human mind – even though we are capable of thinking about things coolly and logically, we often jump to conclusions on emotional grounds and then enlist our cognitive abilities merely to rationalize decisions and conclusions we have already made. Philosophers would encourage us to resist such impulses and to stop and think before jumping to conclusions. This can of course be quite challenging just because of the way in which our brains are wired – the neural pathway between sensory input to motor and cognitive output is shorter in its trip through those parts of the brain that process emotions than it is through our higher cognitive powers. But still, whoever said leading an examined life was the easiest thing to do? 3.1.1 Appeal to authority My friend who is a scientist insists that global warming is not cause for alarm, and for me that is a good enough reason to accept her conclusion. This fallacy is also known as “appeal to inappropriate authority.” Appealing to authority is a commonly used way of trying to convince people. But why do we find authorities believable in the first place? Because they are authorities? In this case we may wonder why they are considered authorities at all. On the other hand if they have something to back up their claims, why don’t we just see for ourselves whether they are right or not? 3.1.2 Ad hominem There is no need to take that animal rights activist seriously. After all, she also benefits from the use of animals – notice her leather shoes and fur mittens. The name of this fallacy is a Latin expression meaning “against the person.” It is also known as the “abusive fallacy,” or “personal attack.” This very popular fallacy focuses on the personal inconsistency of the person giving the argument in an attempt to discredit their argument. People who use this strategy don’t respond directly to their opponent’s argument but bring up external reasons not to believe anything he or she says. This is clearly wrong since it is the argument that someone gives and its validity and soundness that should be our concern not the person from whose mouth that argument happens to be coming. 3.1.3 Popular appeal (bandwagon fallacy) The Romans were justified in slaughtering thousands of slaves. After all it was a part of their culture and not many people objected. This fallacy involves appealing to what most people or the majority of people think as a way of determining what is really true or really right. But as pre-civil rights segregation laws show – what the majority wants or believes can very easily be wrong. The fallacy known as the “appeal to tradition” is similar in that it claims that tradition, the way people have been doing things for a long time, is a good enough basis for us to believe or act as they did. This, of course overlooks the possibility that they were wrong or had no good reason to believe or act as they did. 3.1.4 Appeal to force The reason that we are right is because we have the military might to get rid of any government that disagrees. However effective force or threats of force may be in getting people to do what we want, we may wonder whether this approach really is attempting to convince anyone of anything. Even though threats may get people to say that they agree with you, this shows nothing about whether or not the conclusion is true or whether they really believe what you are saying. 3.1.5 Appeal to consequences If astronomers are correct, the earth orbits a relatively insignificant star in a remote corner of one galaxy among billions. But this conclusion violates our sense of the significance of our own lives and so it must be false. This fallacy involves rejecting some particular viewpoint, theory or idea based on the consequences to which it leads. These consequences are often emotionally loaded, the kinds of things that we may not want to believe. However, it is often simply irrelevant whether or not we like or want to believe something: the truth may in fact be indifferent to what is pleasing to us. The way to tell what the truth of the matter is, is to examine the evidence rather than reject a theory out of hand because it has unappealing consequences. 3.1.6 The naturalistic fallacy Women alone are capable of having babies. So the responsibility of raising and taking care of them is entirely theirs. Next we have the naturalistic fallacy. We often appeal to nature as if natural things, practices, etc. were automatically good. This is perhaps understandable in a world filled with various artificial substances of dubious safety. But we should be careful of making such appeals since they involve a leap of logic. The problem with the naturalistic fallacy is actually quite a general problem – the attempt to conclude something about what should or ought to be be the case from what simply is the case. In this example, the facts of how human reproduction work entail nothing about who should play what role in raising children. That is a matter of social relations that, us philosophers hope, should be based on a free and open (and rational) discussion between those involved and not on the “facts of life.” 3.1.7 The genetic fallacy Newspapers are businesses that make profits from selling papers. So we should distrust what they publish since it is bound to be affected by their desire to make money. Arguing like this is a more general version of the naturalistic fallacy. We often assume that where something comes from affects its nature in fundamental ways and so we automatically tend to distrust research that is paid for by corporations, we distrust claims made by people who stand to gain from what these claims are about and so on. Although it may seem like wise advice to “follow the money” and keep in mind that those who pay the bills might use their power to determine the content of the conversation, insisting that this must be the case simply does not follow. In the case of the news media, the fact that a large newspaper corporation makes money for its employees doesn’t automatically slant what exactly they are saying in one way or another. This is because one part of their business strategy might also be to maintain high standards of independently verified journalistic integrity. If they are selling their reputation as reliable reporters, and there is an independent way of determining the truth of their claims, there is not necessarily a conflict built into the idea of selling newspapers. Just as in the case of other fallacies of relevance, such as appeal to authority and ad hominem, in this case what matters is not so much who is saying something but what is being said, and we can see for ourselves whether or not it is reliable or slanted in any way. 3.1.8 Red herring We shouldn’t worry that much about people dying of horrible diseases in Africa. After all we have problems of our own to deal with. The name of this fallacy comes from the British method of fox hunting. First a captive fox is released and then a pack of foxhounds follow its scent trail, followed in turn by the hunters. In order to make it a little more difficult for the hounds to follow the fox, a piece of smoked herring (a smelly fish that typically is red in color) is wiped on the ground across the fox’s path and thrown off to the side somewhere. This serves to distract and confuse the hounds and gives the fox a chance to get away. In an argument whenever you bring up something irrelevant in order to draw attention away from the topic at hand you are relying on the fallacy of red herring. The problem with the reasoning in this example, of course, is that there is no mention made of the possibility that both problems in Africa and problems here can be addressed. Besides mentioning something off the topic in no way undermines whatever claims are made about that topic. 3.1.9 Weak analogy Galileo was ridiculed because of his views, and these views later proved to be correct. I too am ridiculed for believing that the Pope is a reptilian alien in league with the Freemasons. Thus I too will have my day and my views will be accepted. Analogies are comparisons between different things. We reason analogically when we argue that because one object or concept has a certain feature, other objects or concepts that are similar in certain respects will also have that feature. This is an important way in which we make sense of the world. However, it has its drawbacks. If we are not careful we can end up making analogies when they are not really there. This argument is based on a weak analogy because it is just not the case that all views that are ridiculed end up prevailing in the end. Some do, like Galileo’s, but the reason was not inherent in their being ridiculed, but on their being based on good reasoning supported by evidence in the appropriate ways. And by the way, there really are people who believe that the Pope is a reptilian alien, just google it and see. 3.2 Fallacies of Ambiguity The next set of fallacies relies on the fact that many terms have multiple meanings. Switching between meanings without acknowledging that one is doing so is a way of making invalid reasoning look valid. Closer examination reveals arguments that do this to be weaker than at first glance. Here we will consider just a few examples. Many more often appear in debates and you can find out about many more examples by following the links at the end of this chapter. 3.2.1 Equivocation People in jail are really free. This is because if you can think whatever you want, then you are free and people jail can certainly think whatever they want. Equivocation is using multiple meanings of a word as if they were the same. We start out with one meaning of a word like “freedom” and end up with another meaning, in the attempt to fool the person who is listening to us that our reasoning is valid. Since many words have multiple meanings it is important to watch out for subtle shifts as an argument progresses. 3.2.2 Straw person The senator who suggested cutting funding for the new Air Force attack drone system really wants to leave us defenseless against our enemies. Thus we should reject such cuts. This fallacy often appears in the context of a debate in which one person misrepresents his or her opponent’s view in order more easily to knock it down, like a person made of straw. This is a fallacy of ambiguity in that it relies on a superficially similar version of the view that is being attacked rather than the view itself. One can often “win” debates by using this strategy, but such victories are hollow in that they do not really engage with the real issues. If you really want to demonstrate that some view you are attacking is worthy of rejection, it is far better to rely on the “principle of charity” and present your opponent’s view in as favorable a light as possible. If it still fails, then your position may look even better. The drawback, however, is that if you represent your opponent’s views in a more fair and favorable light, your objections to them may themselves not hold up. But that is really only a drawback if you care more about winning debates rather than in figuring things out. 3.2.3 Cherry picking This study of 12 children clearly shows a link between childhood vaccination and autism. Thus vaccines cause autism. This one is really no joke – in fact the whole of the current scare about childhood vaccinations and autism was “established” by a single study of twelve children! The fact that the paper was retracted, and its author was barred from medical practice didn’t matter since its influence only grew since the date of its publication. The logical mistake here is that of selectively reading the evidence in favor of your own hypothesis, or “cherry picking” the data to get the juiciest bits while ignoring anything that contradicts it. The other name for this fallacy, “Texas sharpshooter” refers to the related practice of proving your worth as a target shooter by first shooting random holes in the side of a barn, and then afterwards drawing your target around a cluster of holes so that it looks like you are a great shot. Is this done in Texas? Probably not, but whoever named it must have had a low opinion of Texans – no offense intended and if you are from Texas, substitute your state of choice. 3.2.4 Fallacy of misplaced concreteness I feel so agitated after I watch the news. That is not so surprising though, since the media is trying to scare us all. How often have you heard someone say something like “it’s the media’s fault?” While this may be a common way of talking about things, it makes a subtle mistake in reasoning. It treats an abstract noun, “the media” which refers to many different organizations, publications, companies and their vast numbers of employees, owners, stockholders, etc, as if it were a concrete noun: the kind of thing that could meaningfully be referred to as being at fault for something. Concrete things, such as individual people can of course be at fault. Some organizations, such as corporations, can be at fault in a legal sense that they are liable for damages if they do something that is illegal. But can “the media” really be at fault for anything? What would this even mean? To be at fault for something, I for example, have to knowingly and willingly do something that is illegal or otherwise wrong. But this requires that I can know things and will things, that is, that I am person with a functioning mind. When we talk about abstractions like governments, the media, society and so on, were are no longer talking about particular concrete things, however. Instead we are talking about collections of organizations, institutions, and of course all of the many particular people who run them. And such collections are just not the kinds of things that can do anything on their own. This is not to say that individual news agencies, reporters, publishers or whoever, wouldn’t be responsible for knowingly publishing false or misleading information. Of course they would be. It is also not to say that there might not be general trends – clearly governments run by one particular political party tend to do things that governments run by another party would not. It’s just that we have to be careful about talking about these abstractions – the government, the media, society – as if they were real agents making deliberate decisions. To do so would be to commit the fallacy of misplaced concreteness. 3.3 Fallacies of Presumption The third set of fallacies we will consider here are those that make presumptions, often in a hidden way. That is, they rely on hidden and unstated assumptions written, as it were, between the lines. This strategy, however, cannot withstand critical analysis since if we can get the perpetrator of such fallacies to acknowledge these hidden presumptions we can see them for what they are, mere assumptions without warrant. 3.3.1 Mere assertion Abortion is just wrong, and that is all there is to it. This is the simplest and most obvious kind of bad reasoning. As the name implies, mere assertion involves simply stating what you want to establish without presenting any evidence whatsoever to support it. It is truly amazing how often people simply assert something that they may think is true without bothering to offer anything to support this assertion. 3.3.2 Begging the question You should become a Christian. This is because the Bible says that if you are not a Christian you will go to Hell. This strange sounding name really applies to a very simple technique. Someone who begs the question is guilty of assuming what they are claiming to establish in their argument. In other words they put a disguised version of their conclusion in the premises of their argument. That is, they are not really arguing for what they claim to be arguing for. This is an example of a fallacy that is nevertheless a valid form of reasoning. The problem here is that we cannot just assume that the conclusion is true, as someone who uses this way of argument is in fact doing. Begging the question is not, of course, always so obvious. We can see that this is a case of begging the question when we realize that the only people who will be convinced by this argument are Christians. Why? Simply because nobody else will take evidence from the Bible seriously, and people who consider the Bible as authoritative are already Christians. This example also shows why begging the question is also known as “preaching to those already converted.” 3.3.3 Appeal to ignorance The claim that the death penalty deters crime has not been established with any certainty. Thus it is clear that it does not deter crime. The fact that something has not yet been proven to be true does not mean that it is false. It is just unknown! Yet this fallacy assumes that if we do not have proof of something then that thing must be false. 3.3.4 False dilemma (black or white fallacy) Either living organisms are products of blind chance or they were deliberately designed. But it makes no sense that something as functionally complex as a living organism is the result of blind chance. Hence they must have been designed. The argument here rests entirely on an assumption that is not always so easy to see, the assumption that the alternatives stated are the only ones there are. If this were the case, then the argument would stand, but often other alternatives are simply not even mentioned. Hence the dilemma, or forced choice between two alternatives, is here a false one. In the example below, which is often used against the theory of biological evolution, the missing alternative is precisely what Darwin articulated in his book On the Origin of Species, a theory which contains an element of chance but which is not reducible to the blind chance that this argument presumes is the only alternative to deliberate design. 3.3.5 Hasty generalization All three of my ex-wives always told me what to do. This clearly shows that all women want to control us men all the time. We may be tempted to conclude a lot from a single case, or a relatively small sample, but this is often merely a way to confirm our prejudices. If we really want to make sweeping generalizations, we’ll have to gather a bit more evidence in less clearly biased ways than this. 3.3.6 Slippery slope If we legalize physician assisted suicide then everyone over sixty had better watch their backs. Once doctors get used to helping people with terminal illnesses die comfortably, they’ll find it easier to get rid of older people. Slippery slope arguments are often used as a way of warning us of the dangers of allowing people to do something that is now forbidden. They say, in effect, if we allow someone to do this, then they’ll have no reason not to do that, which is much worse. The name comes from the metaphor of an icy ski slope: if we are foolish enough to step onto the slope, without skis on of course, we’ll end up uncontrollably sliding down to the bottom. The problem with this argument is that it claims that we must end up where the arguer claims we will, but the argument gives does nothing but assert that. 3.3.7 False cause The majority of heroin users smoked marijuana when they were younger. So smoking marijuana must be one of the causes of heroin use. Us humans are very good at noticing patterns in the world around us. In fact science is based on this ability – we notice regularities and then come up with explanations for them. The most powerful of these explanations involve attributing a causal relationship between events that appear to be related to each other in a regular way. We have to be careful here, however, since we also have the tendency to overdo this. This may seem like a convincing argument until we recognize that the fact that something tends to happen before something else is not nearly enough to establish that the first thing causes the second to happen. For example, the fact that my alarm clock goes off every day shortly before sunrise does not mean that my alarm clock causes the sun to rise. The same goes for drug abuse. The fact that I abused marijuana first and then heroin later does not mean that the first caused the second. It is equally possible that I abuse whatever drugs I abuse for another reason – I have major problems I am trying to escape from. 3.3.8 Circular reasoning He must be guilty, since he has a guilty look on his face. Furthermore, the look on his face indicates guilt, because he is the one who did it. This final fallacy in our list is, in a sense, a more complex version of begging the question. Circular reasoning involves bouncing back and forth between two assumptions each of which is supposed to be the basis for the other. To see the circular structure of the reasoning exhibited here it may help to figure out which statement is the premise and which is the conclusion. In this example, at first glance it seems like the conclusion is “He is guilty,” and this seems to be based on the premise that “He has a guilty look on his face.” However, the fact that the look on his face indicates guilt is then supported by the assertion that “He did it.” Clearly we are moving around in a circle – our premise supports and is supported by our conclusion. There is thus no real support for either and the whole structure is unfounded. This fallacy is also known as the “vicious circle” fallacy. 3.4 Cognitive Biases Fallacies, as we have been seeing, are common mistakes that we make in reasoning especially when we are trying to support a conclusion that we have insufficient evidence to support, ways in which we claim more than we really know. In recent years cognitive psychologists have also explored the ways in which not only get our arguments wrong, but also tend to get things wrong in our own thinking, how as Thomas Gilovich puts it in the title of his book How We Know What Isn’t So.1 That is, we have a tendency to fall prey to biases and mistakes in our own reasoning whatever it is that we may end up defending later in our arguments. In this section we’ll look at some of the most important and relevant of these cognitive biases. In general we might classify these biases into two general types: “hot biases,” or motivated irrationality where our interests, emotional responses or visceral reactions to things influences our thinking process; and “cold biases” or unmotivated irrationality which are a result of certain mental shortcuts and routines we rely on even in situations where they do not really apply. Let’s look at some examples. Hot biases involve bending our reasoning to fit our wants and desires. Because of this definition I believe that hot biases can be pretty easy to spot throughout our daily lives and interactions with others. That is if we take a step back and evaluate our reasoning and emotions within the situation. However, unlike hot biases, cold biases are not results of our desires, but rather they are more like “bugs” in our mental operating systems. When you get into cold biases, I believe that this is where things could get tricky. – Ryan Moore The reason I believe that cold biases can be very tricky to spot is that they are simply caused by the way our minds are wired as humans. This means that when dealing with these cold biases in any situation, the odds are already stacked against us. Even when attempting to avoid the use of bias in any situation, debate, or reasoning process, cold biases may rear their ugly heads without us even fully understanding that they are present. One cold bias strikes me in particular, “The fundamental attribution error.” What this refers to is our tendency to be more generous with ourselves when trying to excuse our actions or get ourselves off the hook than we tend to be regarding others. The reason this bias struck me was because, without even noticing it, I have just recently fallen victim to this cold bias in my own life. To make a long story somewhat short, my girlfriend was in a fender-bender about 2 months back. She was at fault, as she rear-ended the person in front of her. Everybody was okay, and there was minimal damage, but there was still enough damage for it to be noticeable. Well, when I got home from work, she told me the story of what had happened and showed me the damage. In this situation, after she showed me the damage and explained it, I was giving her grief about being more careful when driving probably for the rest of the night. At that point in time, I didn’t want to hear any excuses. I was just annoyed that the car was going to need some work. However, not even two weeks after that incident, guess what. I rear-ended someone on my way into work. Honestly though, what are the actual chances? Again, luckily nobody was hurt (besides my ego), and there was very minimal damage. All I had was a cracked headlight and the other car had a small scuff. Well, later that night when I got home from work, I explained to my girlfriend what had happened. However, this time, I was ALL for using every excuse in the book of how it wasn’t my fault (when in reality, if you rear-end someone, it’s almost always your fault). Looking back on this situation, I fell victim to cold bias. While my girlfriend and I basically committed the same fault, I was much more generous with myself when I was the one who messed up. Overall, it is my opinion that cold biases can be much more difficult to spot and stop as compared to hot biases. 3.4.1 Hot Biases Hot biases are also known as examples of “motivated irrationality” because they involve bending our reasoning to suit our wants and desires. Our motivations may not always be clear even to us, so we may not realize that we are caught up in such biases. Luckily, however, there are steps we can take to avoid falling prey to them. 3.4.2 Confirmation bias Confirmation bias is our often unconscious tendency to give more weight to evidence supporting our pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses and our tendency to downplay the significance of evidence against them. The result is similar to cherry picking but it may not be a deliberate attempt to mislead, but more of a product of other unconscious tendencies. I keep seeing more and more evidence in favor of my hypothesis! What about the evidence against it? Well that must be based on faulty data collection. Given that we have a strong tendency to fall prey to this bias, what steps might we take to avoid it? For one, we can use various “blind” methods of data collection and analysis to protect our reasoning from the errors involving confirmation bias. “Double blind” medical trials follow these precautions – to avoid confirmation bias, the patients involved in the trial of a new drug, for example, don’t know whether they are getting the drug or a pacebo, and the researchers also don’t know whether each particular patient they examine afterwards are in the test group who receive dthe drug of the control group that didn’t 3.4.3 Group think Just like our pre-existing beliefs can influence what we take the evidence to support, likewise with our connections to other people can do so. When someone in a group we identify with comes up with an idea we have tendency to give it more weight than in fact it deserves. A great example of this occurred during the Kennedy administration with the Bay of Pigs incident. The plan was to send a small group of armed anti-Castro Cuban soldiers to the Bay of Pigs in Cuba with the thought that that would be enough to incite a full-scale revolt against the Communist government by the rest of the Cuban population. Enough members of Kennedy’s National Security Council which planned and approved the incursion were strongly in favor of it that they collectively ignored their own military intelligence which indicated that there was little popular support for revolting against the Cuban government. So when the invasion happened in January 1961 the initiative was quickly defeated and the Cuban exiles who landed in the beach were quickly arrested and imprisoned much to the embarrassment of the Kennedy Administration.2 3.4.4 Wishful thinking These last two biases could be considered specific examples of a more general tendency we have towards wishful thinking, which is the tendency to project our own desires onto reality and fool ourselves into thinking that reality conforms to how we would like it to be. I just know that the Yankees will win the World Series, they just can’t let me down again! All of these biases fail to make a distinction between what we would like to be the case and what really is in fact the case. We may end up lucky and happen to find out that reality conforms to how we would like it to be, but then again we may not. We can protect ourselves against these kinds of biases first by being aware of our own tendencies to fall prey to them and then by using particular strategies to separate our analysis of the evidence from our wishes. 3.4.5 Cold biases Cold biases differ from hot biases in that they are not such much results of our desires but of the ways in which our cognitive systems work. They are more like “bugs” in our mental operating systems than ways in which we twist our thoughts to conform to our desires. 3.4.6 Anchoring/framing effects How much are you willing to pay for some given product or service? Well it turns out to depend not just on the features of that product or service itself but also by what is next to it on the shelf, what other options you are presented with and even the initial asking price. These are examples of the ways in which the context of our choices influences the content of our choices. Many examples of this can be found in the marketplace. The notorious “bait and switch” tactic relies on this bias. Today only, you can get a new Toyota for 20% off the sticker price! So act now and drive your new car away today! There are numerous ways in which advertisers and salespeople try to influence our choices. First the “sticker price” may or may not reflect anything about the reality of the product in question but may be intentionally inflated to anchor our minds to a price higher than we would actually pay. It turns out that doing so will make us more willing to pay a higher price than we would if the original non-discounted price were set closer to what we might actually pay, or what the manufacturer expects us to pay. Likewise, adding extra options that we may not actually be interested in independently can influence our willingness to buy a product, especially when it is compared to an otherwise equivalent product without those potions. In both cases our ability to compare what is offered with what we want is corrupted by the context within which the product is presented.3 3.4.7 The fundamental attribution error When it comes to explaining human behavior, and trying to figure out the relative weights of internal factors such as needs, desires and the personality of the actor on the one hand, and external situational factors on the other hand it turns out that we come up with different weights when thinking about our own behavior and that of other people. our own and others. We tend, for example, to put more weight on things outside of our own control when accounting for our bad behavior than we do when accounting for the behavior of others. The fact that I tripped when walking down the street was because the sidewalk was uneven. When you trip on the other hand, it’s evidence that you are a klutz. In other words we are more generous with ourselves in terms of getting ourselves off the hook — it’s not my fault it’s the situation I was in — than we are with others — clearly it is their fault! This is true that in many, many cases, if we looked at things in the more neutral terms of finding what factor most influence all of our behavior situational or external factors often play a much greater role than we think. So we are more accurate when we reflect on ourselves than when we look at the behavior of other people. Our attribution of causal influences tends to be skewed in the wrong direction when we look at why others do what they do especially when we compare it with our understanding of what influences us ourselves. 3.4.8 The availability heuristic Finally in this brief survey of some major cognitive biases we have the confusion we tend to make between how readily something comes to mind (its “salience”) and the more objective probability of its occurrence (its “frequency”). Thus because terrorist attacks are so dramatic and stand out in our minds much more than the more common and mundane threats we are exposed to we tend to be more afraid of terrorism than, for example, driving to the airport. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks I remember listening to an interview with an expert on national security threats. The interviewer asked him what we could all do to be safer in international air travel and his response was “Drive very carefully to the airport.” This effect, once you start to notice it, is everywhere. We focus on dramatic if also highly unlikely threats and events and ignore those that are far more likely and hence, paradoxically, not so obvious to us. In this and the last chapter we have taken a closer look at what is involved in the justification of any claim at all. We have seen that the best arguments are both valid and sound – they work logically in that their premises really provide adequate support for their conclusions and their premises are actually true. We have also examined some of the many mistakes in reasoning to which we are prone. These mistakes are not only used in a deliberately misleading way, since all of us have a tendency to make decisions and judgments first and then come up with reasons in support of them later. Thus we often rely on fallacious reasoning to rationalize our own beliefs or we tend to read the evidence is biased ways. As we will be seeing, as we turn now to start examining some of the many different theoretical approaches to ethics, the tools of logic and critical thinking will prove very useful in trying to come up with a reasonable answer to the general question, “what is the right thing to do?” 3.5 Slideshow Summary download print new tab 3.6 📺 Our Buggy Moral Code Dan Ariely explores rationality and irrationality as they intersect with ethics in his talk “Our Buggy Moral Code.” Further exploration There are many great websites that list, discuss and explain the many ways we get things wrong in our thinking.

We’ll be looking at a variety of theoretical perspectives on ethics – perspectives which determine the position one might take regarding questions such as: Is ethics just a matter of opinion, or is can ethical principles lay claim to a more universal validity? What is the relation between ethics, law and religion – all of these spell out rules for behavior but on the basis of what and what happens when they come into conflict? Is it rational to be ethical or does ethics depend on something other than our ability to think things through? Is there anything that is just plain wrong, no matter what the consequences? There are many possible ways to consider these questions. I’ll be following a fairly common approach that looks at them in the light of various general theories or philosophical positions one might adopt. Each of these theories makes a particular claim about what is fundamental to ethics, highlights certain aspects of our ethical lives and also provides some guidance for dealing with ethical controversies in the real world. These theories have all found both defenders and critics in the history of philosophy although here I will be more concerned with them as general approaches to ethics than with worrying too much about accurately presenting the views of historical thinkers. These theories as I am presenting them can best be looked at as “ideal types” that have their own inner logic, and their own strengths and weaknesses as attempts to articulate and defend some version of what ethics is really all about. In my view not all of these theories are equally viable. In fact it seems to me that most of them simply fail as approaches to ethics for a variety of reasons that will become clearer in each case. This brings up the obvious question of why we should bother looking at a whole slew of approaches to ethics that ultimately don’t work instead of just more directly articulating one that does. There are two reasons to take this approach. First, in spite of the difficulties faced by these approaches to ethics, all of them continue to be popular and find defenders both historically and at the present. Even if these defenses are inadequate, they still have and have had their champions. There is a version of an old joke about anarchists that applies here to philosophers: given three philosophers in a room together there will be four positions taken by them on any topic that comes up for discussion. This is a feature and not a bug of philosophy, since philosophy is the attempt to articulate and defend a general account of such abstract topics as the nature of reality, knowledge and values, so the more particular positions we can examine the better. Just like in science we should welcome a diversity of approaches rather than rule any out at the start. But unlike in science, unworkable philosophical theories have a longer shelf life since the cost for holding on to them is relatively easy to bear. If a scientific theory is fatally flawed that is typically clear – one’s prediction of what the experiments or data will show fails, other explanations cover more cases with fewer assumptions and better fit with the data, the bridge built on the basis of one’s calculations collapses. The cost of bad science is steep. In philosophy, however, the costs of holding onto unsuccessful theories is having to put up with theoretical incoherence, to be willing to hold conflicting views in the mind at the same time. And it turns out that us humans are pretty good at doing these things – all you have to do to live with a poorly worked out set of fundamental beliefs is stop thinking about them. The second reason for considering a multitude of unsuccessful approaches to ethics here is that each of these approaches does have the advantage of focusing on some important aspect of ethics. To the extent that these theories fail it is because they tend to overemphasize the aspect in question and ignore others. Looking at a variety of approaches can thus help give us a clearer picture of what ethics as a whole is all about, even in the absence of some final master theory that would unify ethics once and for all and win universal assent. It seems to me that there is a certain “logic” to the story I’ll be telling here, even if it is nothing like a necessary development, a magical dialectical unfolding of the Truth about ethics, but I do present each theory as an effort to take in to account the failings of the proceeding accounts. Making sense of our ethical lives and thinking clearly about ethics is hard, but it seems to me that it is worth the effort. Philosophical ethics may not be an empirical science, and debates in ethics may not ever be resolved, but it is a rich field well worth exploring. My presentation here is intended in the spirit of a guidebook, pointing out certain general features of the landscape, some important landmarks and major hazards to be reckoned with. So much for a general account of what we will be up to here. This section of the text looks at two approaches to ethics that may seem to be diametrically opposed – cultural relativism and the attempt to show how ethics can and should be based on religion. According to cultural relativism, ethical rules and norms are determined by culture in the sense that there are no absolute and universal rules with an independent warrant, but only particular, culturally determined ways of conducting oneself, none fundamentally better or worse than the others. According to religious approaches to ethics, ethical rules and principles do have an absolute foundation and that foundation is to be found is an authoritative set of religious truths. In spite of their obvious opposition, with relativism denying the existence of ethical absolutes and religious approaches affirming it, in a sense both have something essential in common, which is the idea that ethical rules come to us “from outside” and have little to do with human choices. Their opposition lies in whether or not the source of ethical rules varies from place to place or not. Both of these approaches will be found wanting, for roughly parallel reasons. And so the next part of the text, which examines various more purely philosophical approaches to ethics, takes up the question of what ethics might look like if it is something we humans create and not imposed from outside by culture, God or human nature. A note on method: In this text I’ll be exploring various approaches to ethics chiefly as I understand them. Although at times I make reference to historical philosophers and sometimes to their particular arguments and texts, this book is not intended as a contribution to historical scholarship. Instead my approach is to consider ethics in terms of a series of “ideal types” which, while they may overlap with the ideas of certain historical figures, are intended to capture what I understand to be the major lines of argument available to anyone who attempts to clarify basic notions of ethics. There is a certain inner logic it seems to me to how we can, and maybe even should, think about ethics. Or maybe that is just a result of my having spent too much time reading Hegel in my youth. In either case, caveat lector – let the reader beware. Over time I will also try to expand on and/or make room for approaches I haven’t yet had time to integrate into my overall scheme, such as virtue ethics, Buddhist ethics (and non-Western approaches more broadly) and feminist approaches to ethics. I do welcome suggestions about how to extend and revise this text to make it more inclusive. 4.1 Claims and Consequences of Moral Relativism If anyone, no matter who, were given the opportunity of choosing from amongst all the nations in the world the set of beliefs which he thought best, he would inevitably – after careful considerations of their relative merits – choose that of his own country. Everyone without exception believes his own native customs, and the religion he was brought up in, to be the best. —Herodotus, The Histories Opinion – this seems to be where ethics starts and in many people’s minds where it ends. You have a right to your opinion about right and wrong and I have a right to mine, so let’s just leave it at that. Given what we have been looking at so far, not to mention all of the unread pages still ahead, it is probably already apparent that that is not going to be the whole story about ethics. It is nevertheless a deeply rooted assumption that ethical claims must be opinions, since they are clearly not factual claims and that seems to be the only other sort of claim we can possibly be making when we are using language to state things. That this assumption does not in fact hold up to closer inspection is what this chapter is going to argue. Humans are incredibly diverse and in many ways. We are diverse in appearance; we live in many ways in many different environments; we speak many different languages and embrace many different beliefs, practices and norms. People live in almost any conceivable physical environment, from dense tropical jungles, to frozen polar deserts, from small villages with thatched huts to modern industrial cities made of concrete, steel and glass. In addition, our cultural practices and norms reveal perhaps an even greater diversity. Some human cultures place value on devotion to the group at the expense of individual liberty, others emphasize the unique individual while downplaying our relation with others. Some cultures value continuity and tradition while others value innovation and rapid change. Some cultures value constant productive work while others place far more emphasis on living well and enjoying social interaction with others. Some cultures allow men and women to participate equally in all areas of social life, while others have entirely separate spheres for the two sexes. Recognition of this diversity is what has led some philosophers and social scientists to formulate a theory known as “cultural relativism,” which takes these casual observations and turns them into an explicit set of claims about the nature of value judgments. This theory is not only a popular theory about the nature of values. It also presents a challenge to the whole enterprise of philosophical ethics since it leads to the view that rational discussion and argument have little role to play in ethical decision making. Ethical decisions, opinions and judgments, according to cultural relativism, are always relative to the cultural environment within which they are made. Cultural relativism is one particular variant of a broader position that holds that moral universals are impossible in principle and that moral judgments are closer to judgments of taste than they are to anything else. Just as with judgments of taste, according to this view, sometimes called “moral anti-realism” for its denial that there is any basis in reality for determining what is right and what is wrong, there is little point in arguing about moral issues since they reduce to personal preferences. I won’t go into the various versions of this idea here but will focus on the claim that moral values and judgments are essentially rooted in culture. The issues that this view raises, it seems to me at least are broadly the same as those faced by other variants and so dealing with cultural relativism will be enough for our purposes here. So let us then look more carefully at what cultural relativism claims. It is a meta-ethical position that boils down to a few simple and seemingly obvious claims: According to cultural relativism Ethical or moral claims are not objective in the way factual claims are. There is no neutral standard for determining right or wrong. All value judgments are relative to our personal or cultural perspective. 4.1.1 A first case for relativism At first this set of claims may seem obviously true. After all, given the diversity of human values and customs, how could there be anything more than relative standards, standards that are only applicable within a given culture? Many people find relativism intuitively appealing and might even offer as a preliminary case for relativism the following points: Cultural diversity: Human culture has always been extremely diverse. And many people seem to have equally diverse views on what sort of behavior is acceptable. It seems to follow from this that there cannot possibly be any standards for deciding between these views. How we learn about values: It seems obvious that we learn about values, and come to accept the values that we do because these are the values that are shared by the people who raise us. They are the values of our families and communities. Intolerance: There have been plenty of cases throughout history in which one group of people firmly believed that their values were not just acceptable for them but absolutely right, and used this as a justification for committing atrocities against other people. Relativists insist that the only way to avoid this kind of intolerance is to accept that there are no ultimate standards. 4.1.2 What is at stake In a moment we will consider each of these points in greater detail. Before we do this it will be helpful to spell out what is at stake here. That is, we should consider what would be the case about ethical principles and decision making if cultural relativism were true. Its defenders make much of the positive consequences of this theory, while its opponents emphasize its negative implications. As we consider these consequences of the theory we must remember that whether or not we like where a theory leads us, in terms of its theoretical consequences, cannot itself determine whether the theory itself is correct. Reality does not care whether or not we like it. In the case of relativism at least, the extreme nature of its consequences helps explain why it is such a controversial theory. Defenders of relativism present it as the best way to acknowledge the great variety of human value systems and cultures. If there are no ultimately correct moral principles, then all human cultures become equally valid as ways of life, at least for different groups of people. This seems to encourage tolerance of other ways, a welcome relief after millennia of people intolerantly fighting with each other over their different views. After all, if there are no ultimate standards for right and wrong, we would could never justifiably say, “Your group is wrong in doing what you do and so we have the right to force you to change your ways.” On the other hand, a relativist cannot really consistently promote tolerance – otherwise she would be granting tolerance for other cultural practices the status of a universal value, valid for everyone and this is what relativism says does not exist. So we should really say that relativism really only rules out one possible way of dealing with conflicts: the rational settlement of differences with reference to some kind of universal principles or values. Sometimes differences of opinions might be tolerated by the members of the groups that differ, sometimes one group will attempt to push its values on the other group. Both approaches are consistent with the claims of relativism. The first troubling consequence of relativism is one you may already have suspected: if there are no real standards, standards about right and wrong that are independent of cultural perspectives, it doesn’t seem possible to condemn other cultures or individuals for doing awful things. For example, imagine that there is a society that has two major groups of people. One of these groups, who happen to be the majority of the population, decides that the other group doesn’t deserve any respect, perhaps even that they are somehow naturally deficient or inferior. As a result they perform painful and often fatal experiments on the minority group, force them to work without pay, and even decide just to kill them off because it makes them feel better about themselves. What would a relativist say about this? It seems that since the relativist is only willing to recognize local or relative standards, she would have to conclude that although she doesn’t like it, or that such behavior would never be tolerated in her society, she really can’t condemn what this group of people are doing as simply being wrong. Why not? Well, because it seems right to the majority of people in that other society. Furthermore, relativism, if it were true, would require us to reject the idea that we can really make moral progress. Consider voting rights for women and African-Americans. In early American history both groups were denied these rights. Later on, after the Civil war in the case of African-American men and then in the early twentieth century in the case of all women, the Constitution was amended when people recognized that it was wrong to restrict these groups’ access to the political process just because of race or gender. Many of us would consider this a case of moral progress – a basic right was extended to people who had previously, for no good reason, been denied this right. What would a relativist say? Could they say that this was really a case of progress? Probably not, since progress implies that things are getting better, and this requires that there is some standard against which we can measure better or worse. So, for the relativist there is no such thing as progress, only different ways of doing things, none of which are really better or worse than any others. Is this a conclusion you are comfortable with? Relativism seems like a plausible theory about the nature of value judgments. It also seems, at first glance at least, to be a theory with nothing but positive implications – it seems to encourage of diversity and lets everyone do their own thing. However, as we have just seen this easy-going character of relativism soon reveals a darker side. A relativist cannot really have any grounds for condemning any behavior at all, no matter how intuitively awful it seems, as long as someone believes that it is OK. In addition relativism does away with one of the most important parts of our moral thinking, the idea that maybe through our efforts we can make things a little better. This idea of progress is rendered simply meaningless by relativism. These implications of relativism do not by themselves let us know whether or not relativism is true. At best they reveal what the stakes are – if relativism is true we get tolerance at the expense of having to tolerate anything all at that someone feels is the right thing to do. To determine whether or not relativism is true we need to consider more explicitly the arguments in support of this theory. Consequences of relativism If relativism is true: Nothing can be condemned as just plain wrong. Moral progress is a meaningless idea. Different cultures speak different, mutually incomprehensible moral languages. But remember – just because a theory has consequences we don’t like doesn’t mean it’s false. Saying so would be a fallacy. 4.2 Defending Relativism The life history of the individual is first and foremost an accommodation to the patterns and standards traditionally handed in his community. From the moment of his birth the customs into which he is born shape his experience and behavior. —Ruth Benedict, Patterns of Culture4 Thus far we have been looking at the pros and cons of accepting relativism as an approach to ethics. In doing so we have been avoiding asking a simple question, that we now cannot any longer avoid – is relativism true? To answer this question we need to take a look at how we might argue for relativism instead of just leaving it as one opinion among others that we might take or leave. Although it may seem obvious to many people that relativism is in fact true, our examination of the explicit case that can be made in defense of relativism will show that it is not in fact based on very good arguments. But I am getting ahead of the story… 4.2.1 Cultural differences The first and most obvious way to defend relativism is based on the recognition of human cultural diversity. This was what motivated Herodotus to pronounce that “custom is the king of all,” and what has also led many anthropologists and sociologists to embrace similar views. So the first argument for relativism that we will examine here rests on recognition of the diversity of value judgments and tries to argue from this premise directly to the conclusion that there are no ultimate standards for right and wrong. We all have different views about right and wrong. Thus there are no standards about what is really right or wrong. This argument may seem to be persuasive. Doesn’t the fact of human diversity automatically entail relativism? But the question we should ask about this argument is not “Does it seem persuasive?”, but “Is it valid and sound?” Remember, a valid argument is one in which if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true. So is this argument valid? How can we tell? In this case the premise seems obviously true, but does that by itself force us to accept the conclusion? Clearly not, since even if the premise is true and we do all disagree, this alone does not have to mean that there are no standards. However implausible it may seem that there are universal moral standards, the fact of human disagreement about what those standards might look like is just not enough to rule out the existence of standards. To see this more clearly, it may help to consider a more obviously bad argument of exactly the same logical form in which the premise is clearly true and the conclusion is clearly false. 4.2.2 A counterexample We all have different views about how to deal with stop signs – some people come to a complete stop while others only slow down. Thus there are no standards regarding stop signs. The premise in this argument is clearly true. Yet the conclusion is also clearly false, since there really is a correct way to deal with stop signs, the one written in the relevant section of the laws governing driving. What this shows about the argument from cultural differences is that disagreement alone is not enough evidence for the conclusion that there are no real standards. From the fact that we may disagree about some topic we cannot conclude anything about whether or not any of us are really right or really wrong. We need much more evidence than this to support the conclusions of relativism. In fact we disagree about many things. In some of these cases there is a way of settling disagreements – look up the law, check the facts if we disagree about the temperature outside or whether or not it is still snowing. In other cases, there is simply no way to settle differences – some people will just not be convinced that the Backstreet Boys are horrible musicians, or that sushi is the best dish on the planet. Likewise in all matters of style and taste. So this argument for relativism is inconclusive. Relativism focuses on our differences of opinion and tries to draw from this a conclusion that just does not follow. We still are no closer to deciding whether, as in cases of dispute about the law, we will be able to settle our ethical differences, or whether, as in cases of dispute about taste, we will not. It remains an open question whether or not there are standards in ethics. Given that disagreement about something does not conclusively tell us whether it is possible to settle the dispute we are left with the questions: Are ethical disputes more like disputes about the law or the facts where there is some possibility of resolving them? Or are ethical disputes more like disputes about taste where the best we can hope for is to agree to disagree? 4.3 The Argument from Learning A second way to argue that relativism is true is to appeal to how we acquire moral concepts. It seems plausible that we get our ideas about what is right and what is wrong by learning them from those around us. We may have certain built-in reflexes but moral judgments seem to be learned and not to be innate. The evidence for this would be their global variability and their local consistency. Cultures around the world differ in terms of their basic moral concepts, so this story goes, but we each tend to embrace values similar to those in our immediate social environment. This is a commonly held view on morality – the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Likewise it is also a commonly held view that raising a child with strict moral guidelines is the best way to ensure that she will continue to adhere to those values later in life. We will get back to the question of whether or not this is really the best way to look at morality in a moment. For now we can grant it as the premise for a second argument in defense of relativism. If we get our values from our cultural environments then our values are culturally determined. If values are culturally determined then they are relative to cultures. We do get our values from our cultural environments. Thus relativism is true – values are relative to cultures. This is at least a valid argument. If in fact values are best understood as ideas that we pick up or learn from those around us and what we learn is relative to the cultural environments in which we happen to grow up, cultural relativism seems to follow. The question then becomes whether or not it is sound. Are the premises in fact true? The key premises are the first and the third. Consider the first premise: “If we get our values from our cultural environments then our values are culturally determined.” There are two ways we might understand this statement – one of which makes it true by definition and the other of which makes it just plain false. If getting our values from our cultural environments means the same thing as our values being culturally determined, then the first premise is true, but completely uninformative, since it gives us no new information. It just tells how we happened to acquire an idea. Of course if I learn about the meaning of the symbols for numbers and mathematical operations in a math class then they are “relative” to the class I learned them in. But if, on the other hand, this claim is not true by definition it is in fact false, since it just does not follow that where we get an idea in any way determines what the content of that idea is. As a counterexample: just because we learn arithmetic within the particular cultural environment of a particular math class does not mean that the content of arithmetic is at all determined by this environment. 2 + 2 = 4 wherever you happen to learn it. What we learn is at least in principle independent of where we learn it. Saying otherwise is to commit the genetic fallacy. The third premise, “We do in fact get our values from our cultural environments,” is equally suspect. It is possible that this is true, but it assumes some things about human psychological development that are simply unknown at this point in time – the extent to which the ideas that we have in our heads are products of our immediate environments, and the extent to which they are products of built in psychological capacities and functions. Well then, where would ideas about right and wrong they come from, if not from the environment in which a person is raised? One possibility is that human moral development is somewhat built in, that we are all born with the capacity for social interaction and that this gets switched on, in a sense, as we grow and interact with others. And maybe, moral rules are, just like mathematical truths, things that we discover in our interactions with the world and other people. Just as we all come to see how more abstract ideas about quantity, space and structure work by generalizing from the details of our interactions with things in space and time, why couldn’t we learn about the value of kindness and generosity and fair treatment in and through our interactions with other people? If this view were correct we would expect to find that the variation of moral ideas among is humans is less pronounced than relativism claims. And in fact, if we ignore the surface differences between human value systems and look at the core values people seem to accept, they start to look much more similar than moral relativism would lead us to expect. 4.4 Difference and Tolerance Relativism isn’t quite finished yet though, since there is another popular argument in its favor that we haven’t yet considered. This argument appeals to the, once again seemingly obvious, difficulty in coming to any kind of agreement about the meaning of basic moral terms. Here it is in explicit form: When I say that human life is important I mean one thing by that statement. When you say the same words you mean something completely different. Hence relativism is true and there are no universal values. Once again, this argument might convince someone who already is partial to relativism, since it might seem obvious that our different opinions about what moral concepts mean can only be rooted in fundamentally different value systems. But is this really so obvious? It seems to me that one reason why it appears so obvious to so many people has do to with a hidden assumption that is at work here. This hidden assumption is that everyone’s values form a coherent whole, a system of inter-connected ideas, commitments and preferences that each of us uses to make sense of the world we live in and the rules of the social game within which we find ourselves as actors. According to this assumption values are passed on from generation to generation as complete “packages” and not as individual ideas or preferences. If that is the case, and if moral terms only themselves makes sense within the context of different value systems, then it would be expected that people with different value systems would just have to mean different things by terms such as “right and wrong.” And, furthermore, if we are to learn how to get along with each other and tolerate other ways if life, this would also seem to entail tolerating entire value systems that might be very different than our own. The question is, however whether this assumption about the way things work with values is true. We will see some reasons to doubt it in the next section. For now, all that needs to be pointed out is that this assumption is itself just another way of expressing the fundamental claim made by relativism – that values are essentially rooted in some kind of cultural or personal framework. Thus this last argument really amounts to a restatement of relativism’s basic outlook and shouldn’t really count as an independent argument in its favor. If it were it would be another case of begging the question and that is not really a legitimate way of arguing anything. 4.5 Questioning Relativism In recent years even in the field of anthropology, which was once the field most committed to the truth of relativism, there has been a growing emphasis on the universal values underlying culturally different ways of expressing those values. To take a few examples, we all: honor the dead with some sort of funeral rites and find it incredibly offensive to mistreat the dead. act so as to help the group to survive. believe in the importance of telling the truth in general, even if exceptions are sometimes made to this. distinguish between acceptable and wrongful killing of other human beings. The possibility that there is a common moral ground between groups of people is tempting as a possible alternative to relativism. What relativism gets right is the fact that we all disagree about how to carry out the basic moral demands these core values impose on us. But what it gets wrong is the degree to which we do all disagree. After all, we all have some way of honoring the dead, we all think that the survival of our group is important, we all recognize that communication is only possible against a general background of truth-telling, and we all agree that there is something that should be considered the wrongful killing of a human being or murder, even if different cultures have very different ways of putting these values into practice. But then, wait a moment, doesn’t relativism just reappear on another level? So what if we all agree on the importance of honoring the dead? Our different views about how exactly to do this have the potential to lead to serious conflict. How might we resolve this kind of conflict? To see how we might respond to the question of whether relativism simply reappears at another level of analysis – that of the implementation of supposedly common core values – let us take a closer look at what I claimed above was one of the common core values all human cultures share, the distinction we all make between acceptable and wrongful homicide. The relativist might argue that the fact that we all agree that there is such a distinction does nothing to alleviate the conflicts between different ways of interpreting its meaning and putting it into practice. Take the way in which this value was put into practice in Nazi Germany: it was considered wrong to kill a member of the “Aryan” race, but acceptable and even necessary to kill Jews, Slavic people and Gypsies (among others). We, on the other hand, fought against Germany in WWII because, among other reasons, we disagreed that this was a legitimate way to make the distinction between acceptable and wrongful homicide. Our beliefs are that it is only acceptable to kill others in self-defense, in a just war or, in some cases, as a penalty for very serious crimes. Is there any way to resolve this conflict, or does relativism gain back all of the ground it has lost in the preceding discussion? It seems to me that there is. Respect and avoiding causing harm to others is a good place to start. Its like that quote, “Your freedom stops where my nose begins”. – Marlene Goodbrod Once we recognize that even Nazis are not living in an utterly foreign moral universe, that they share with us the basic idea that there is an important moral distinction between justified and unjustified homicide, the whole game changes. We are no longer faced with a disagreement about fundamental values, those core moral beliefs that that seemed so personal and out of reach to discussion and critical evaluation. Instead we have a conflict about something that at least seems amenable to criticism and revision – our understanding of what exactly is going on, or the facts of the situation. Is there really such a thing as fundamentally different biological races? Are there any measurable differences between groups of people organized by skin color, facial features, or ethnic origins? Is there really a plot to undermine “our” group that is being carried out by a network of shadowy agents from “their” group? These are no longer moral questions, but questions of fact. And while such beliefs and the story-line they are often connected with about hostile inter-group relations do tend to take hold of many people at times of great social stress, and under the influence of demagogues, at least it seems like there is hope for changing people’s minds about these questions. 4.5.1 Summary Relativism is a difficult position to come to grips with. First of all it seems completely obvious to many people that it must be true, especially those who are sensitive to the ways in which us humans differ from each other. But the fact that many people come to discussions of relativism already thinking that it is true masks the fact that it is hard to defend with explicit arguments in favor of it that don’t beg the question. And then there is the deeper philosophical question of whether it is even a coherent position that makes any sense at all. In some sense it may not even be possible to deny the truth of all truth as more extreme versions of relativism seem to do. Can a relativist ever lay claim to being correct about anything including the correctness of relativism? In case she did, then anyone else could simply say, “well relativism may be true for you, but it’s not true for me!” But relativism also presents a challenge to its opponents since it seems to acknowledge how firmly it is that we all tend to stick to our sense of what is right and what is wrong. People do tend to dig in and refuse to either accept reasons against their own favored views or even the possibility of compromise. In spite of this, however, radical changes of viewpoint as a result of reflection on one’s own values are possible. See the links below for some examples. What these show, it seems to me at least, is that it does make sense to look at values as amenable to rational reflection and justification. We will look at some different ideas about what this involves in the third part of this book. Before we get there, we will need to open up two more cans of worms – the view that the only way to provide a solid backing for value judgments is if they are based on some kind of absolute authority (chapter 5); and the view that value judgments either are or should be essentially self-serving (chapter 6). 4.6 A Starting Point If relativism shuts down debate with its assertion that we can never get beyond individual perspectives to any kind of moral common ground, our arguments against relativism put the burden squarely on us. If there is such moral common ground we’ll have to be able to find it and articulate it in ways we can all accept. But this proves impossible if we don’t understand the basics of our different views on things.
