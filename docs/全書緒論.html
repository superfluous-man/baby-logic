</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>This is Plato’s version</em></strong> of an eyewitness’ account of the last living moments of their teacher Socrates. Socrates was executed in 399 BCE in his hometown of Athens, Greece in the customary way of being given a cup of poison hemlock extract to drink, for the crimes of “corrupting the youth” and “preaching false gods.” What he really did was spend his days engaging his fellow citizens in dialogue about anything and everything, but especially focused on questions concerning how we all should live our lives, as well as challenging everyone he met to account for and defend their assumptions about how to live. But his relentless questioning earned him many enemies who preferred that the youth, and everybody else, rest content in the assumption that the best way to live is to seek fame and fortune and try to live the “good life” that these seem to make possible. Socrates was not convinced and advocated the life of the philosopher, turning away from worldly pursuits and instead reflecting on and critically examining our deepest assumptions and ultimately being willing to admit how little we really know.</p>
<p><strong><em>Socrates</em></strong> was famous for his saying that “the unexamined life is not worth living.” What he meant by this is that all of us have a responsibility to examine our own beliefs and try to figure out whether or not they are really true. Not doing this is like sleepwalking through life. This might be pleasant but it runs the risk of us devoting our lives to things that don’t truly matter, and even worse it leads us to neglect developing our unique capacity as human beings. Unlike other animals, we can mentally take a step back from what we see in front of us and ask, “Should I trust what I see or not?” Likewise with everything we do: we can examine our own desires, intentions and plans and ask ourselves, “Should I act on these or not?” In both cases we are capable of distancing ourselves from the immediate demands of our situation and seeking orientation from another source – we seek <em>reasons</em> to believe or doubt what we see and <em>reasons</em> to follow or resist our urges. This reflective capacity is the source of our strength since it has enabled us to understand and manipulate the world around us like no other creature on the planet. But, as we can now see more clearly than perhaps Socrates could, it also puts us in the uniquely awkward position of having to justify ourselves to our own worst critics, ourselves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Another famous, although fictional figure</em>,</strong> who shows the difficulties that our ability to reflect can pose is Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Writing at the dawn of the modern era, which saw the expansion of human populations to the current seven and a half billion of us in the span of a few short centuries, and the resulting crowding out of many other life forms, Shakespeare sums up the human predicament when he has Hamlet say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The capacity</em></strong> to reflect is the source of both our godlike “apprehension” and the difficulties we inevitably encounter in figuring out what we should do with ourselves; our ability to dominate the world we live in and the difficulties we sometimes face in finding a solid sense of purpose and direction. What <em>should</em> we really do with our short time here on this planet and why? Should we live our lives according to the standard routine, and accumulate more and more stuff, seeking one “peak experience” after another to file away in our memories? Or should we look for a higher purpose, whatever <em>that</em> might be? Even though, thankfully, most of us do not experience the tension between these two aspects of our ability to reflect on ourselves and our circumstances quite as dramatically as Hamlet did, all of us face this essentially human predicament – being masters of the universe and yet feeling lost at the same time. As we will be seeing in this text, philosophical ethics is another, much less bloody, way of exploring it. To set the stage for what we will be up to here I want to first say a bit more about our unique reflective capacity and our ability to pay attention to <em>reasons</em>. This was what Socrates had in view when he questioned his fellow Athenians about what they thought was the best way to live. Then I’ll turn to a more detailed account of what is distinctive about philosophy in general and philosophical ethics in particular.</p>
<div id="what-do-i-know" class="section level2" number="1.1">

</h2>
<p><strong><em>Another Ancient Greek philosopher</em></strong>, Plato’s student Aristotle, defined human beings as, “rational animals.” We are like all other animals and come equipped with nervous systems that enable us to perceive what is happening around us and respond in real time. Animal nervous systems are the product of hundreds of millions of years of evolution, and are extremely useful for helping animals survive and flourish in a complex and constantly changing environment. But what is distinctive about the human nervous system is the degree to which the constant stream of information coming into it through our senses is integrated and organized. It is integrated in an experience which is, as far as we can tell, more fully conscious than that of other creatures. And it can be more explicitly examined and critically reflected on, enabling us to <em>reason</em> about how reliable it is and whether what it presents us with is really true. We can make explict to ourselves our own thought processes and subject them to critical analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>This is a point</em></strong> that it is hard to overemphasize but also easy to miss since we take it so much for granted. By asking ourselves about the reasons we have for believing that some aspect of our experience is true we are asking ourselves not only about the way things seem to us, but about the way things <em>should</em> appear; not just what we happen to believe about things based on their appearance to us, but about what we <em>should</em> believe about them because it reflects their true reality. And by asking ourselves such questions we are asking what philosophers call <em>normative questions</em>, questions that have to do with values, with concepts like right, wrong, good, bad, true, false, beautiful and ugly. We not only perceive and think, but also judge our own perceptions and thoughts according to standards that are more general and weighty, going by the lofty names of Reason, Truth, Reality and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Aristotle also defined human beings</strong> as “political animals” since we live together in societies organized around explicit rules and social norms. Here as well we don’t have to simply act on whatever urges we feel most strongly, or even just follow along with what others expect of us, we can stop and think about what to do instead and think about whether it is <em>right</em> to do or not.</p>
<p><strong><em>Our ability to reflect</em></strong> on our choices and actions introduces a normative dimension to human practical and social life as we come to ask ourselves questions about our own needs, desires and decisions as well as about the rules governing our social lives. We may wonder what we <em>should do</em> in some particular situation, maybe when our impulses lead us in one direction and our experience and reason says otherwise; or when we feel social demands imposed on us that we still feel uncomfortable with. Consider the following famous fictional case.</p>
<div id="a-difficult-case" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>A difficult case<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-difficult-case"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div class="question infobox">
<p>Imagine that you are standing next to a railway track and notice a runaway trolley coming down the tracks. There are five children further down the track who are too far away to hear you. There is also a switch in front of you, that would divert the trolley to another track. Unfortunately there is also a single worker on this other track, who is himself to far away to hear you.<br><br><em>Would you throw the switch and cause the worker to most likely die in order to prevent the runaway trolley from hitting the children?</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong><em>This classic case</em></strong> of an ethical dilemma has been extensively studied by philosophers and moral psychologists.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Originally developed by Judith Jarvis Thompson 50 years ago, this problem has lately seen practical application in the development of self-driving cars.&lt;span class="citation"&gt;[@davisWouldYouPull2015]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a> It presents us with a situation in which we most likely feel torn between two alternatives, neither of which seems to be acceptable or desirable, but in which we also may feel unable to refuse to pick either. Cases like this are good at bringing to the surface the intuitions and assumptions we make about what the right thing to do might be, and that is why they are often studied by philosophers and others interested in looking more closely at moral decision making. One significant result of the study of this case is that a large majority of people say that if they were in that situation they <em>would</em> throw the switch. Many of us feel compelled to follow a common moral idea: all else being equal, do whatever saves the most lives. But then consider the following variation on this case.</p>
<div class="question infobox">
<p>Imagine that you are standing on a bridge with a low railing over a railway track and notice a runaway trolley coming down the tracks. There are five children further down the track who are too far away to hear you. There is also a very large person standing next to you, and if you gave him a slight push he would fall in front of the trolley car causing it to derail, thus saving the five children.<br><br><em>Would you push the person off of the bridge in order to prevent the runaway trolley from hitting the children?</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong><em>In this case</em></strong> a large majority of people say they <em>would not</em> push the person off of the bridge even if it would save the five children. Given that the result is the same in either case, the question then becomes why it is that in the this version of this scenario we no longer look at it in terms of gut feeling that it is better to do what leads to more lives being saved.</p>
<p><strong><em>Whatever the explanation</em></strong> for this discrepancy may be (and there is an entire academic industry that has developed around research into the trolley dilemma) the important point here is that philosophers are interested in both examining cases like this directly and in studying how it is that we all tend to respond. Cases like this help us to see and hence to start examining the deeper assumptions we rely on in our thinking about right and wrong. In general this is what philosophy as a discipline is all about – exposing to view and carefully examining the assumptions we make about how the world works, what we can know about it, and what matters. This is exactly what Socrates meant by leading “an examined life.” He insisted that if we never bothered to reflect on our own deepest assumptions about reality, knowledge and values we would be missing out on what may truly make life worth living. You may disagree with him that this kind of examination is something that we should all devote our entire lives to as he did, but he does have a point worth considering. If we never take the time to deeply reflect on our assumptions, are really ever living <em>our own</em> lives?</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Philosophical Ethics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#philosophical-ethics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><strong><em>Philosophical ethics</em></strong> is nothing but the deliberate pursuit and clarification of this kind of reflection on our own values, actions and decisions. Even though, as I have been emphasizing, we all have the capacity to reflect on our lives and choices, we do not always spend the time or make the effort to do this carefully and deeply. This is because we are mostly preoccupied with the immediately practical details of our lives. We are too busy living to take the time to stop and think about the significance of what we are doing. However, at times in the lives of both individuals and societies the need to reflect more clearly on what we are doing becomes more urgent. For individuals the need to stop and think and to reconsider the basic assumptions on which we act often arises in relation to important life events or radical changes – the sudden loss of a loved one; the birth of a child; living through a natural disaster or a war; or even the transition to adulthood in which one assumes full moral and legal responsibility while also gaining the full rights and privileges of adults. These are topics and situations, as we will see later, that are often the focus of discussions in the branch of philosophical ethics called applied ethics. In the case of societies, philosophical thinking likewise flourishes in times of great stress or change – for example when radically different societies suddenly make contact with each other; when new groups and ways of living displace old groups and ways; when new discoveries challenge peoples’ basic views of the nature of things; when societies find their very existence threatened by seemingly insurmountable obstacles. In cases like these it becomes more obviously important to reflect carefully on what we assume is valuable to us both individually and as a society, on what counts as a good life.</p>
<p><strong><em>A philosophical approach</em></strong> to ethics, or moral philosophy<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout this book I’ll be using the terms “ethics” and “morality” as basically synonymous. Some people distinguish between the two terms in one way or another and that is fine as far as it goes. But since the reason English has both terms is that we borrowed each from a different language – “ethics” comes from Greek, while “morality” comes from Latin – and both original terms mean something pretty similar, I see no reason to insist on any fundamental different meaning between them.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a>, looks at a few different kinds of questions. So the broader field of ethics can be divided up into a few different sub-fields. These are:</p>
<div id="descriptive-ethics" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Descriptive ethics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#descriptive-ethics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div class="question infobox">
<ul>
<li>What do people really think about right and wrong?</li>
<li>How can we best describe and explain people’s moral claims and beliefs?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Descriptive ethics</em></strong> is not exclusively a philosophical approach to ethics – sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists and other social scientists are also interested in studying people’s ethical, moral and social beliefs. From the perspective of descriptive ethics, our beliefs and principles are things to be studied, categorized, organized and explained. This is what social scientists do for a living.</p>
</div>
<div id="meta-ethics" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Meta-ethics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#meta-ethics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div class="question infobox">
<ul>
<li>How does ethical thinking work and how does it compare with other forms of thinking?</li>
<li>Are ethical claims nothing but <em>opinions</em> as opposed to the <em>factual</em> claims made scientists?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Meta-ethics</em></strong> is a higher-order or “meta-level” discussion <em>about</em> ethical thinking. Here again, philosophers as well as social scientists often ask meta-ethical questions in their attempts to understand what is distinctive about ethical thinking as opposed to other modes of cognition. Looking at ethics from this perspective does not involve taking a stand on particular ethical principles or issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="prescriptive-ethics" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Prescriptive ethics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prescriptive-ethics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div class="question infobox">
<ul>
<li>What is <em>really</em> the right thing to do?</li>
<li>What moral principles are really justified and should be followed?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong><em>This approach</em></strong> to ethics is the uniquely philosophical attempt to find the true basis of ethical thinking. We will be spending a lot of time here examining various attempts to give an account of the basis and justification of ethical thought, belief and action. This way of approaching ethics is not scientific, to the extent that science concerns itself with “value-neutral” descriptions and explanations of whatever phenomena it is addressing. That philosophy can succeed in making normative claims while remaining based on objectivity and rationality is up to philosophers to establish.</p>
</div>
<div id="applied-ethics" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Applied ethics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#applied-ethics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div class="question infobox">
<ul>
<li>What is the right thing to do in real-world cases of ethical controversy?</li>
<li>What assumptions and principles lie at the basis of ethical controversies?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong><em>How does all of this play out</em></strong> in real life cases? Under this heading are also to be found discussions of ethical issues associated with some particular area of human life, profession, or subject matter – hence medical ethics, business ethics, legal ethics, environmental ethics, bioethics and so on are sub-fields within applied ethics.</p>
<p><strong><em>We should keep in mind</em></strong> as we proceed that these various approaches are not always so clearly separate from one another. Our description of what people believe about ethical questions, for example, is clearly often informed by what we think they are justified in believing. Nevertheless we should keep in mind the fact that we can look at ethics from each of these different points of view and recognize that failing to do so may result in unnecessary confusion.</p>
<p><strong><em>In conclusion</em></strong> we might say that philosophical ethics involves deliberately reflecting on our ideas about ethics in general and on specific applications of these ideas to actual cases and controversies. Another term for such deliberate reflection is “critical thinking.” This should not be looked at as a primarily negative activity as the word “critical” might suggest, but as the positive attempt to arrive at the truth of the matter by thinking carefully about what are often complex and ambiguous ideas and concepts. Even though, as I mentioned at the outset, all of us are equally capable of reflecting critically on our own beliefs, desires, actions and values, it does take some effort and quite a bit of practice to be able to do so effectively. This is because critical thinking is a skill like anything else that we might do with our minds (like solve algebra problems or identify different species of trees) and we shouldn’t expect to be experts at it from the start. In the <a href="#logic">next chapter</a> we will look at and get some practice using one of the most important tools for critical thinking – the logical analysis of arguments.</p>
