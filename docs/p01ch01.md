Reality is, you know, the tip of an iceberg of irrationality that we've managed to drag ourselves up onto for a few panting moments before we slip back into the sea of the unreal.\

## Further exploration {- #further-3}


**_There are many_** great websites that list, discuss and explain the many ways we get things wrong in our thinking. Here are a few of my favorites.

[*Your Fallacy Is*](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/){target="_blank"} is a nicely designed website with more examples of common fallacies.

[*Your Bias Is*](https://yourbias.is/){target="_blank"} is the sister site to Your Fallacy Is and focuses on common cognitive biases. 
   
[*Logically Fallacious*](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies){target="_blank"} is a site with a huge and comprehensive list of logical fallacies and cognitive biases. A great reference with lots of examples.
   
And you should of course follow the [Logical Fallacy Ref](https://twitter.com/fallacy_ref){target="_blank"} on Twitter.
