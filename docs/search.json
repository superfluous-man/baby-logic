Likewise, according tradition, humans alone souls, thus unique position control nature, animals part non-human nature subject control.modern philosopher Rene Descartes took Christian idea animals souls logical conclusion suggested animals much common inanimate machines, clocks, human beings. animals bodies, movements subject, according scientific perspective Descartes helped create, entirely mechanical explanations. animals souls, also lack comes soul – inner experience, experience pleasure pain, experience one’s thoughts, fears desires. Since, Descartes argued, according tradition going back least Old Testament, animals souls, thus incapable experiencing anything, even pleasure pain. explain animals appear experience things, like pain example? Well, dog makes noises result injured, kind thing alarm clock set go certain time – makes noises purely mechanical reasons. Since clocks dogs lack souls noises experienced “inside” anyone anything – “nobody home” inside dog clock. ethical implications ethical implications – however treat animals OK, since God give us dominion animals, even really experience kinds things experience ask others harm us set back interests.extreme view dogma difference challenged somewhat, though entirely, later philosophers, like Kant. Kant believed, seen basis genuine moral relations persons ability understand means respect another . requires rationality, ability understand abstract idea respect. Since, view, animals lack ability, neither owe us owed respect. terms Kant’s distinction persons things, animals fall entirely side things, possessing merely instrumental value. However, Kant recognize certain animal behaviors bear analogy human behavior – hence dog cries pain beaten. Whether animal “really” feeling pain person beats matter much fact seems . Kant reasons seems us animals feel pain mistreated may serve harden us human suffering, unwelcome outcome. Kant clearly endorses dogma difference since belief mistreating animals bad effects human relations humans underlies view abuse animals much.Since nineteenth century however, development science biology fundamentally challenged one major supports dogma difference challenging strict separation animals humans scientific grounds. modern biology amply demonstrated, made basic stuff, complex biochemicals organized ways types cells, tissues organs animals. , now completely accepted biology, related living things, lowliest fungus scale complexity complex mammals – part single, vast family tree going back first appearance life earth four billion years ago. addition deep similarities life forms, much evidence human behavior different animals’ behavior (especially behavior mammals) Descartes others believed. evidence comes form studies physiological basis human animal experience behavior.

Consider modern “factory farm” biology put work maximize yield animals human purposes. Modern methods animal production involve:Living conditions designed maximum efficiency feeding growth – cows feedlot get fat quicker use less land cows open range; pigs bred lean consistent flesh produced shortest period time.Scientifically engineered diets designed make grow quickly possible – cows raised meat feed high protein diets give flesh rich fat content us humans taste ; animal feed mixed growth promoting disease inhibiting antibiotics.Special methods employed particular results address problems caused intensive production: chickens beaks partially cut keep killing attack overcrowded coops; veal calves kept moving keep flesh tender; pigs increasingly raised indoors decades bred rapid meat production makes incapable surviving natural habitat, outside quickly killed cold disease.Use hormones increase yield: milk cows injected hormones produce milk feed supplemented animal protein (ground cows, chickens, horses, pigs, etc.) enable produce extra milk.made possible increased understanding way animals work. ironic result biology supports idea animals different us maybe might deserve moral consideration, time enables us make much efficient ruthless use animals meat milk production machines. result biology, animals, paradoxically, appear like persons moral value like things instrumental value.
