</h1>
<p><strong><em>Our first topic</em></strong> in applied ethics is the topic of euthanasia (and/or physician assisted suicide – these are not really the same thing, as we will be seeing shortly, although for convenience we will use the term “euthanasia” to cover both). The topic of euthanasia is not only a topic debated often in the public arena, but a central topic in the branch of ethics known as bio-medical ethics. The reasons for the importance of this topic are pretty obvious – the debate about euthanasia arises from the dilemmas of aging and dying in a world in which medical technology often permits us to continue to live in spite of major medical problems brought on by aging, disease or misfortune. Modern medicine enables us to prolong life as never before, but in some cases prolongation of life ceases to be such an obviously good thing. So the question arises as to whether it is ethically permissible, in certain kinds of situations, to choose to die, to help others to die, or to even cause them to die.</p>
<p><strong><em>The word “euthanasia”</em></strong> itself comes from two Greek words meaning literally “good” (<em>eu</em>) and “death” (<em>thanatos</em>). Some of the questions that arise in connection with euthanasia have to do with this literal meaning:</p>
<div class="question infobox">
<ul>
<li>Is there any such thing as a good death, or is death just plain bad?</li>
<li>What exactly would constitute a good way to die?</li>
<li>Who, if anyone, can or should decide when the time is right for a human life to end?</li>
<li>Should medical professionals be involved in any way in decisions to end people’s lives, or should they only be permitted to try to prolong life?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong><em>The first three questions aside,</em></strong> for now, it is perhaps the last of these questions that has led to modern controversies about euthanasia. Modern medicine has given doctors enormous power to prolong life through radical surgical procedures and life sustaining technology that can keep some people in desperate medical conditions alive indefinitely. Thus medicine has had to confront a new dilemma: should doctors do whatever they possibly can to preserve life, in keeping with their traditional role, or should they accept moral limitations on this power to keep alive. Formerly doctors faced primarily technical limitations on what they could do, and so the chief moral responsibility they had was not to harm patients. But now that those limitations have been greatly reduced they find themselves face to face with questions about the value of life – is it worthwhile to live whatever the cost in medical resources or individual suffering? Are there some lives that are no longer worth living, even though the technical means of extending them are available?</p>
<div id="types-of-euthanasia" class="section level2" number="11.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">11.1</span> Types of euthanasia<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-euthanasia"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><strong><em>It is important,</em></strong> when we are discussing euthanasia, to be clear about what exactly we are talking about doing or allowing. For example, claiming that physicians should be allowed to assist terminally ill patients in ending their own lives is very different from advocating putting all mentally retarded infants to death, in spite of the fact that both could be considered forms of euthanasia. We can avoid some confusion by classifying types of euthanasia based on two separate factors, the degree of activity of the physician, and the degree of voluntary choice on the part of the patient. The role of the physician can be anything from that of a passive spectator doing nothing to assist a patient in continuing to live to that of an active agent causing the death of patient, (not to mention several possibilities in between). Patients, on the other hand can, voluntarily choose to die, or they may not be capable of making choices, or they may simply not want to die. (Don’t be alarmed yet – not all of these possibilities will lead to types of euthanasia that anybody wants to discuss. Some of them will be unethical or even criminal.) The following table lays out the relevant possibilities.</p>
<div class="inline-table"><table class="table table-sm">

<p><br></p>
<p><strong><em>Clearly this way of classifying</em></strong> euthanasia is just the beginning of the discussion. Some of these forms, such as passive voluntary euthanasia, are not at all controversial – we have every right legally and morally to refuse medical treatment for ourselves. Implementing this right can be a problem, but the problem is typically one involving figuring out how voluntary a refusal of treatment really is, rather than the problem of whether or not someone should be allowed to refuse treatment. There are no real moral problems here simply because of the presumption that, as far as medical care is concerned, rational adults can decide for themselves about treatment of their illnesses and when enough is enough. On the other side of the scale, what the chart labels “involuntary euthanasia” is also lacking in any significant controversy, since killing someone or refusing treatment to someone against her will is clearly wrong. Nobody who is a serious participant in discussion about the ethical and legal status of euthanasia wants to defend involuntary cases. These must be mentioned, however, for two reasons. First, we need to distinguish non-voluntary cases, in which the patient has not or cannot express their desires in one way or another, from involuntary cases, in which the patient’s wishes are being ignored or overridden. In other words, it is important to see that the opposite of voluntary may be involuntary or it may be non-voluntary. Second, mentioning involuntary euthanasia is important for historical and argumentative reasons – the Nazi “euthanasia” program, the so-called T-4 program, was a program that killed over 100,000 unwilling victims and this specter of involuntary killing for supposedly medical reasons looms over the debate. As we will see, the danger that such a program presents is one of the motivations for the slippery slope argument against legalizing euthanasia.</p>
<p><strong><em>So the controversy</em></strong> about euthanasia is going to center around assisted suicide and active euthanasia, although as we will be seeing even suicide is subject to debate, as are cases of non-voluntary euthanasia. Assisted suicide has clearly been subject to many legal battles, those involving Jack Kevorkian, for example. It is currently legal in some parts of the United States including Oregon, which passed and implemented a law called the “Death with Dignity Act” in 1995. Active voluntary euthanasia, where, at the patient’s request, a physician administers a lethal dose of a drug, is illegal in the entire country, although it is legal in the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>

</h2>
<p><strong><em>The way I would like to assess</em></strong> these various types of euthanasia is by considering some of the major arguments for and against the different varieties of euthanasia. There are no doubt many other ways to argue about euthanasia than the arguments we will look at, but these are simply some of the better known and more worked-out arguments on the topic.</p>
<div id="against-medical-killing" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Against medical killing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#against-medical-killing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Our first argument is an argument against making any form of euthanasia, whether it is physician assisted suicide or active euthanasia, legal. It goes like so:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="argument">
<p>The role of physicians is to aid in the preservation of life.<br>
Legalizing physician assisted suicide or active euthanasia would require at least some doctors to violate that role.<br><br>
Thus no form of euthanasia should be legalized.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>At first glance,</em></strong> this may seem compelling. The Hippocratic oath, after all, mentions, “First do no harm,” as the primary constraint on the job of the physician. The primary role of medicine is, to add to the plausibility of this argument, to cure illness and relieve pain, and not to be involved in the termination of human life. However, on closer consideration, this approach to the topic of euthanasia soon reveals itself to be too general and inflexible to be of much use. First there are the technical issues involved in preserving life. For example, is a patient in an irreversible coma with severe and permanent brain damage really even alive? In a sense yes – such a person has a heartbeat and can be kept alive indefinitely through the use of a feeding tube, and in a sense no – no amount of treatment will be able to restore function to a brain permanently damaged by, say lack of oxygen. To say the least, cases like this make the role of the physician in preserving life quite difficult to understand and put into practice. In addition, this argument seems to lead to a blanket restriction on physicians playing any part whatsoever in the death of patients. But does this mean not giving palliative care, care intended to alleviate suffering, to terminally ill patients dying, say, of cancer? Medicine is not, in other words, always a struggle to maintain life, but is also often concerned with alleviating suffering. It is this additional role of the physician that is behind the second argument to consider – the argument from mercy.</p>
</div>
<div id="appealing-to-mercy" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Appealing to mercy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#appealing-to-mercy"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>The clearest argument</em></strong> in favor of legalizing at least physician assisted suicide and perhaps also active euthanasia appeals to the idea that we should ease the suffering of the terminally ill. This is the other major role of medicine – helping to relieve the suffering that disease or injury often entail.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="argument">
<p>Some incurable illnesses cause immense suffering that medicine cannot relieve.<br>
In such cases, preventing someone from dying sooner rather than later is wrong since it causes pointless suffering.<br>
Allowing someone to kill themselves under a physician’s guidance, or when necessary, allowing physicians to administer lethal drugs upon the patients request, is the only merciful option.<br><br>
Thus physician assisted suicide, or even active euthanasia, should be legalized.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>This argument clearly</em></strong> stands in contrast to the first argument, since it emphasizes the other aim of medical treatment, the alleviation of suffering. It insists, moreover, that it should be up to patients to determine whether or not their lives are “worth it.” So why not, it may be countered, allow patients to refuse treatment if they deem that their lives are no longer worth living? Well, in some cases, the suffering involved in a slow death is so bad, that it seems cruel not to allow patients to choose assistance in speeding the process up. (This point is central to Rachels’ argument as we will see in a moment.) The argument from mercy rests on the assumption that someone can and should be allowed to give up on their own lives. That’s obvious, isn’t it? Well, not according to Kant.</p>
</div>
<div id="kants-argument" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Kant’s argument<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#kants-argument"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>Part of the difficulty</em></strong> involved in discussing and resolving questions about euthanasia undoubtedly comes from the close relation between euthanasia (voluntary euthanasia at least) and suicide. Suicide has long been a taboo in Western culture, as it is in many other cultures. Suicide is held to be shameful, cowardly, an insult to others towards whom the suicide has responsibilities and/or to God (or the gods). It is a sign of a basic inability to cope with reality. Opponents of euthanasia often emphasize the connection of voluntary euthanasia with suicide. On this view, the person who opts out of struggling to survive a painful illness, or signs a do not resuscitate order is giving up hope and taking the easy way out. Thus as long as suicide is a taboo, voluntary euthanasia, if it is a form of suicide, would clearly also be off limits, not a topic to talk about in polite company, and certainly nothing to seriously consider as a rational response to illness.</p>
<p><strong><em>On the other hand</em></strong> there have always been defenders of suicide, not as something to encourage, but as a possibly rational solution to certain types of problems. The 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, one of the precursors of utilitarianism, wrote a famous essay in defense of suicide. In it he argued that killing oneself in certain circumstances could be rational or even obligatory if the only alternative was to bring harm upon others or suffer needlessly from a painful terminal illness. Kant, in contrast argues that suicide can never be rational, and so, according to his standard method of argument, it cannot be moral.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="argument">
<p>An act can be rational only if performing that act does not undermine the possibility of attaining the goal towards which it is directed.<br>
Suicide is a self-undermining act, since the point of suicide is relief from suffering, but the result of suicide is death – a condition in which there is neither suffering nor relief.<br><br>
So suicide is irrational and hence immoral.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>According to this argument,</em></strong> suicide can never be defended as a moral act, and thus it should be ruled out of consideration in all cases. The problem here, of course, as utilitarian critics of Kant will be sure to note, is that it seems hopelessly unrealistic to judge the real-life complications of the end of a human life according to an absolute moral standard that insists that we all have a duty to struggle on in pain, no matter how awful it is. Nevertheless, Kant’s claim that suicide is irrational in its intentions should give us pause, and keep up from the easy adoption of the attitude that ending one’s own life is ever a purely rational choice.</p>
</div>
<div id="active-and-passive-is-there-a-moral-difference" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Active and passive, is there a moral difference?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#active-and-passive-is-there-a-moral-difference"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>It is a very widely held belief</em></strong> that there is absolutely nothing wrong with voluntary passive euthanasia. Writing a living will and demanding that it be respected does not involve taking any moral risks, and is something that is perfectly legal in all fifty states in the USA, and throughout much of the world. Each of us has the right to refuse medical treatment and thus there is absolutely nothing wrong with asking doctors to stand back and allow us to die in certain circumstances. On the other hand, many people, perhaps even the majority, are opposed to active euthanasia, and assisted suicide. Requiring that doctors passively let us die, at our own request, is one thing, asking them to actually help us to do so is something else entirely. Or is it? James Rachels, in a well known article claims that this moral distinction between letting someone die (acceptable in some cases) and actively killing someone (unacceptable in most cases) does not stand up to scrutiny. In fact he argues that there is no moral difference between actively killing someone and passively letting them die. His argument is based on consideration of a fictional and somewhat implausible case, that of Smith and Jones, both of whom have rich uncles whose money they will inherit. Both Smith and Jones, morally corrupt as they are, decide that they do not want to wait for their uncles to die of natural causes, that is, they decide to kill their uncles.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-1" class="example"><strong>Example 11.1  </strong></span>Jones goes to visit his uncle, who is upstairs at home taking a bath and does not hear Jones come in. Jones, after having picked up a brick outside, creeps in and the up the stairs. He quietly opens the bathroom door and knocks his uncle on the head with the brick. Jones’ uncle is knocked unconscious and sinks into the tub where he drowns. Smith, likewise, pays a visit to his uncle, grabs a brick from outside and creeps up to the bathroom where his uncle, as luck may have it, is also taking a bath. Just as Smith is about to kill him, however, his uncle bumps his head on the soap dish, gets knocked unconscious and thus drowns while Smith silently watches.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>Considering the details of this case,</em></strong> it seems that both Jones and Smith are evil people. Further, their acts seem equally bad – both stand to gain from their respective uncles’ death, both decide to kill their uncles, both approach them to carry out this intention. But only Jones’ brick actually make contact with his uncle’s head, while Smith’s brick hovers a short distance above his uncle’s head. But that seems like a completely inconsequential detail. So what if all Smith did was watch his uncle die, he is just as bad as Jones. Now the point of this case is just to show that in and of themselves, removing all other factors, killing and letting die are morally equivalent. In this case they are equivalently bad. As Rachels argues, in the case of euthanasia, if we accept that passive voluntary euthanasia can be a good thing, then active euthanasia in the same circumstances would be just as good.</p>
<p><strong><em>If there is no essential moral difference</em></strong> between killing and letting die then there is no way to defend the position that passive euthanasia is acceptable while active euthanasia is not. The Jones and Smith case shows that there is no essential moral difference between killing and letting die.
Thus we should either allow both active and passive euthanasia or forbid both.
This seems like a pretty compelling argument. Is there really any way to distinguish active killing and passive letting die? If not then their moral status, whatever it might happen to be, would have to be the same.</p>
</div>
<div id="peter-singers-argument" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Peter Singer’s argument<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#peter-singers-argument"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div class="center">
<div class="argument">
<p>Some people have absolutely no hope for survival for medical reasons – for example, babies born with anencephaly.<br>
There are two choices in such cases, either they can be allowed to die naturally, or they can be painlessly killed.<br>
Medical resources are limited.<br><br>
Rather than waste medical resources on allowing anencephalic babies to die slowly, they should be killed to free up the medical resources where they will do some good.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>In this argument,</em></strong> developed by Peter Singer, the claim is that in some very rare cases active non-voluntary euthanasia can be acceptable. These cases would be very clearly defined cases where there is absolutely no hope for someone, and yet allowing them to die (which will inevitably happen), as opposed to speeding up the process, prevents other people from getting the medical attention that they need. In such cases people should be killed in order to enable others to benefit from medical resources, such as hospital beds, IV drips, etc., that others might benefit from. Clearly this kind of argument is going to ruffle some feathers. But isn’t it true that if we are devoting any resources to someone who has absolutely no chance of survival (and who is also not capable of being even conscious, as is true of anencephalic babies), that is a waste of those resources?</p>
</div>
<div id="slippery-slopes" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Slippery slopes?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#slippery-slopes"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong><em>Naturally, arguments like Singer’s</em></strong> raise the question of whether even thinking seriously about killing any babies, no matter how hopeless their cases may be, is already going too far. Isn’t this just disrespectful of human life, to contemplate throwing it away, however damaged it may be? And doesn’t this kind of disrespect of human life often lead to disrespect for people with less severe afflictions? That is, are we not sliding down a slippery slope, if we accept Singer’s argument? This brings up a standard objection to all varieties of euthanasia that are not currently acceptable, that is to anything stronger than passive voluntary euthanasia.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="argument">
<p>Legalizing assisted suicide or active euthanasia will lead inevitably to the following consequences:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Elderly people will give up hope sooner than they would if they did not have the opportunity to kill themselves or request euthanasia.</li>
<li>Those who pay for expensive treatments will put pressure on patients to choose death.</li>
<li>Doctors will lose a degree of respect for human life and will give up sooner.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these consequences are unacceptable.<br><br>
Thus neither physician assisted suicide nor active euthanasia should be legalized.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong><em>In general,</em></strong> slippery slope arguments are not to be trusted – “<a href="fallacies-and-biases.html#slippery-slope">slippery slope</a>” is the name of a fallacy because the fact that one thing happens does not logically require that something worse will happen, if there is no law of nature that forces it to happen. There clearly is no law of nature that would force us to carry out involuntary euthanasia just because we happen to have legalized physician assisted suicide. As philosophers put it, there is no nomic or law-like necessity here. But, nevertheless, we may wonder whether doing something that seems innocent may not end up having long term detrimental consequences. The slippery slope argument at least demands that we take this possibility seriously.</p>
